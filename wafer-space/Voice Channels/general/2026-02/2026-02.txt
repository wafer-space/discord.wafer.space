@Egor Lukyanchenko Very cool! Do you blow the eFuses at 5V? Also, you mentioned testing chips from Google -- Was that GF180 too or sky130?

Gotta run. This has been interesting and exciting folks! Well done. Looking forward to seeing silicon 🙂

@algofoogle (Anton Maurovic)  Yes, fuses are blown on 5V. GF180, there is no eFuse on sky130 as far as I know.
