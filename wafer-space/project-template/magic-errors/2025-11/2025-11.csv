However, having checked the layout, I don't think I have any cells placed on top of themselves. Could it be because KLayout creates arrays for the filler cells?","",""

The fill generator is looking inside the SRAM, finding ample room to place fill cells on active, poly, metal1, and metal2, and that collides with the abstract view, which assumes that even fill is forbidden from the area (which is likely preferred?).

The two solutions are (1) Create an abstract view of the SRAM containing a *detailed* obstruction map of the interior (that is, not using `lef write -hide`).  That will be a huge LEF file, but it will be accurate with respect to the metal layers.  I'm not sure it will properly represent diffusion and poly.

I tried to resolve the array through the KLayout GUI and `explode` the cell instance array through scripting, but neither method managed to separate the filler cells.
  At least it's not a blocking issue.

2. The maglef covering up the layers makes a lot of sense! Thanks for the hint.
  I would rather not prevent fill inside the SRAMs since this PDK only allows to restrict filler generation on all metal layers.
  I removed the `-hide` argument from open_pdks. The resulting maglefs are 10MB in total (not ideal), but now the fill is correctly inserted.

3. Yes, I already flatten comp and poly2 fill cells. That's not an issue on my side:
  ```

By loading the maglef views, all the DRC errors are resolved. Well, actually, not all of them. By using the maglefs from the current PDK I still got some Metal3 spacing errors in the SRAM periphery. Using the no `-hide` maglefs resolved all of the DRC errors within the SRAM macro.
Could you run magic DRC on the PDK maglefs on your end to confirm my suspicion?

Still, the question is whether we really want to distribute 10MB maglefs for the SRAMs just to avoid checking the DRC rules inside it?
Even if we don't implement the 5V/3.3V SRAM rules, it probably makes more sense to use the `SramCore` layer to skip these DRC checks in the area.
This way I don't need to update the wafer.space precheck every time a new SRAM is generated, and users could generate their own SRAMs.
Even if we don't implement the 5V/3.3V SRAM rules in magic, in the worst case violations should get caught by KLayout.
How difficult would it be to disable specific rules in a certain layer through the magic tech file?","",""

The only way to implement special rules for SRAM is to create an entire alternative set of layers that exist only in SRAM, which is extremely messy.  I did something like that in sky130 to implement a special kind of local interconnect that is inside SRAM, but that was necessary because the local interconnect was part of the abstract views.  At least the GF SRAM cells appear to satisfy normal DRC rules for the metal layers, so the abstract view is DRC clean (apart from weird port entries in GF's own LEF views).","",""

It's really abusing the concept of the abstract view.  It would be easier just to run a few commands in magic to erase layers with the DRC errors.  But let me take a few minutes to see how easy or hard it would be to create some special layers for the SRAM cells. . .  Maybe there are not that many layers involved in the errors?","",""

I absolutely agree, the DRC shouldn't be based on cells. That's why the PDK provides the `SramCore` layer (108/5). The foundry SRAMs use this layer to mark the SRAM bit cells.

Yes, I would rather not generate a detailed abstract view. But this is the only way we can generate the fill afterwards. It would be possible to clean up the detailed views slightly by replacing the the bitcell array with an obstruction.

Ideally, magic could use the GDS directly. I assume people want to create their own SRAM macros for educational purposes, or, in the case of Staf's generator, to generate new SRAM configurations.","",""

I think the problem might be that you still have the original layout for the SRAM in your chip.  The new PDK makes a tiny change to the GDS of the SRAM layout and removes one contact which is too close to (and offset from) the contact array next to it.  Removing that one contact is the easiest way to resolve the issue.  But you will need to update the SRAM cell in the layout.","",""

All of those layers are created and maintained for the duration of the DRC check (and possibly not cleared afterward, but that's not the immediate problem).  They do not cover the whole chip, but they cover a pretty large area because they have to incorporate the effective distance of every rule.  Some rules like ""bloat-all"" can in theory reach across the entire chip and so cannot be clipped to the DRC region being checked, so these layers may span a large portion of the chip.  Vast memory grabs may be the inevitable result of trying to find a way to check every single DRC rule in the deck.","",""
