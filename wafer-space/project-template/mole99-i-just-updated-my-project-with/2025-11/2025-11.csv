For now, the best way forward with GPL is to set `PL_TIME_DRIVEN: False`.

Could you post your STA error? Even better if you could share your repository with the latest changes. Is it still https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/ws-submission-2025?","",""

I was able to reproduce the failure and trace it back to my latest changes to the `pdk_compat` code in LibreLane. `pdk_compat` migrates old PDK variables to newer formats, however, for gf180mcu a number of variables were simply overwritten instead of checking whether they already existed. This makes it impossible to update the PDK variables to the newer format.
Therefore, I added some logic that checks whether the new variables already exist before setting their values.

This worked fine, except for `SYNTH_CLK_DRIVING_CELL`, which it is not a new variable, but its format changed. As this variables already existed in the PDK in the old format, it was not set to the new value, which led to the issue you saw.

As the project template uses a custom SDC file, this issue did not appear there.","",""
