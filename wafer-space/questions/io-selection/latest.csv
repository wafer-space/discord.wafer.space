Any reason to go for slow slew ?","",""

- The schmitt buffer can be used for the clock to prevent false switching/glitches. But I'm not sure if it's absolutely necessary.
- Slow slew: for EMC reasons for example","",""

Like I don't see any case where you wouldn't want a schmitt input for instance. AFAICT from the spec document, it's same delay, same input load, so  why not use it all the time ?","",""
