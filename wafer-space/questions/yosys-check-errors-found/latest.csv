```
39 Yosys check errors found.
```

Grepping for `error` in my yosys synthesis log didn't show any likely-looking errors. I eventually realised that 39 was exactly the number of bidi pad data pins I'd not  yet bothered to connect (early hacking!) so my issue is solved, but next time I get this message, how do I find the actual errors? Is `yosys-synthesis.log` the wrong place to look?","",""

It is definitely confusing that the 08-checker step produces the error but isn't the producer of that file","","👍 (1)"

```
Found and reported 0 problems.
```

And a state_out.json saying:

```
        ""synthesis__check_error__count"": 1
```

Seems like the  actual source for that log lint is here:
