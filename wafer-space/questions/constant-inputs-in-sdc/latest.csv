However, during top-level timing analysis, STA considers changes on the project select inputs in-between clock ticks. As the chip is designed to have those pads permanently bonded/wired to power or ground according to the desired selection, they should be considered constants for the purpose of timing analysis. But how do I codify this in my .sdc file?","",""
