I am building a big switch matrix using standard cell components manually assembled in subckts and arranged in rows and columns. Unclear if ngspice will be albe to simulate it. Right now even a 5 x 25 is very slow and we need to go much bigger. 

We have xschem schematics. Is there a 'smooth' way to start from a netlist generated from xschem and then convert it to a xyce netlist and get it to simulate?

Any worked out examples out there?","",""

You should be able to run a Xyce simulation from xschem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggf9DeVN5k
There are also examples in the IHP PDK if I remember right.

The only incompatibilities between Xyce and ngspice, as I understand it, are the advanced control statements that ngspice supports. If you don't use these, you should be fine.","",""
