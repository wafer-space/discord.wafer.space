""February 14, 2023:  Added PDK variant gf180mcuD, which is like gf180mcuC except has a top metal thickness of 1.1um instead of 0.9um.  According to GF, this is preferred for better wire bonding yield on the pads.  The first open MPW was done with gf180mcuC, but all subsequent open MPWs will be done with gf180mcuD.""","",""
