There are two masks associated with Vt adjustment, TN and TP.  A native Vt device would be defined as the absence of both implants.  The NAT layer is a drawn layer only;  TN and TP are derived from COMP, NPLUS, PPLUS, and NAT.  Of course GF could always _charge_ the customer for the use of the drawn NAT layer, but then they would be douchebags, and anyway I have always assumed that NAT and native Vt devices are available.  The magic tech file supports them.  I have not designed anything using them.","",""
