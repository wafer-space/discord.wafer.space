# **🌐 wafer.space Community Rules**

Welcome to the wafer.space Discord server!

This is a community for discussing open-source silicon, the GF180MCU PDK, and building projects through wafer.space’s low-volume silicon manufacturing service.

----

By joining, you agree to follow these rules to help keep this space friendly, constructive, and enjoyable for everyone:

## 1. Family-Friendly Environment

Keep all conversations safe for all ages.
No adult (X-rated/R-rated) content, explicit language, or otherwise inappropriate material.

## 2. Zero Tolerance for Hate

Nazis, extremist ideologies, or related symbols/messages are not welcome here.

## 3. Respectful & Constructive Feedback

Keep discussions supportive and positive.
Do not insult people or their projects—even if you think something is “silly” or a duplicate of your own work.

This community is a safe place to learn, explore new ideas, and make mistakes.

## 4. Stay On Topic

Use the correct channels for your posts.
Off-topic chatter should go in designated spaces.
Solicitation, self-promotion, and advertisements are only allowed in the appropriate channels.
