It was able to download the GDS but it looks like the tests did not run since it did not find a top cell. As you know we are doing a full custom design (many thanks to Leo for helping Andrew @asc with the padframe); is there a convention we should follow for the top cell naming, for the GDS file, for anything else? 

I also noticed the platform website offers a Project ID and Manufacturing ID; do they need to be put on the chip. 

There is a QR code in the lower right corner. Right now it reads 0000 so I am guessing it is a place holder. Should we change it? How?

I just uploaded our first version to meet the deadline. The toplevel cell is called `chip_top`. We will be making more changes in the next few days but this GDS has everything + filling so it should pass the large majority of the DRC checks without errors. Fingers crossed. 

Thanks, -- Peter Kinget","",""
