The deadline to create a project on the platform and submit an initial GDS remains 3 December AoE. You will be required to update your GDS with the changes I'm currently working on.","","👍 (1)"

Is there an antenna rule DRC checker?
Our GDS is analog circuitry, so it's highly likely to have antenna rule violations. Therefore, we want to check it as soon as possible.","",""

Make sure to enable deep mode for the best performance.
I will integrate this script into the precheck.","","🆗 (1),❤️ (1)"
