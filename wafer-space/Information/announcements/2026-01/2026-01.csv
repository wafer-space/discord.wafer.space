(Thanks @logic destroyer for the suggestion.) You can find the event here: https://discord.com/events/1361349522684510449/1464021932084170875
We look forward to seeing you there! 😃","","❤️ (4),waferspace (2)"

It would also be great to discuss your designs and chat about your experiences with the tapeout.","","❤️ (3)"
