@everyone - People on the mailing list should have just received an email title "Late changing updates -- *Initial* GDS is still due today, final GDS TBD -- wafer.space GF180MCU Run #1" which explains the following:
> Earlier today we got feedback from GF that a number of DRC errors types we were planning to waive can not be waived. Leo (@Leo Moser (mole99)) is currently hard at work updating both the template and precheck to fix these issues.
> 
> The first set of DRC error fixes require changes to the seal ring and I/O pads generated by the template and Librelane. As these are part of the user design, everyone will need to pull the latest version and update their design. The precheck will be updated to verify these errors have been corrected in your submitted design.
> 
> All designs will also need to be 100% antenna DRC clean. The precheck is being updated to include these antenna checks. The template's LibreLane and OpenROAD tooling should already be fixing antenna issues and producing DRC clean results.
> 
> Lastly, the final DRC error fixes require changes to the fill generation. We hope that we are able to accommodate these changes and still meet density targets in all designs. As these are again part of the user design, everyone will need to pull the latest version of the fill generation and update their design. The precheck will again be updated to verify the fixed fill has been generated in your submitted design.
> 
> **I'm requesting everyone create their project on https://platform.wafer.space website and upload at least an *initial* GDS before the upcoming deadline.**
> 
> As we do not yet know the amount of impact from the updates nor the effect delays will have on our planned timeline with GF, I am not yet setting a new deadline for the final GDS but it is likely to be sometime next week.
