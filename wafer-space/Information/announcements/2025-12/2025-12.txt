@Leo Moser (mole99) @Tim 'mithro' Ansell Update/Questions from the MOSbiusV3 team: Yesterday we submitted a GDS to the test-platform and platform. It was able to download the GDS but it looks like the tests did not run since it did not find a top cell. As you know we are doing a full custom design (many thanks to Leo for helping Andrew @asc with the padframe); is there a convention we should follow for the top cell naming, for the GDS file, for anything else? 

I also noticed the platform website offers a Project ID and Manufacturing ID; do they need to be put on the chip. 

There is a QR code in the lower right corner. Right now it reads 0000 so I am guessing it is a place holder. Should we change it? How?

I just uploaded our first version to meet the deadline. The toplevel cell is called `chip_top`. We will be making more changes in the next few days but this GDS has everything + filling so it should pass the large majority of the DRC checks without errors. Fingers crossed. 

Thanks, -- Peter Kinget

@peterkinget - I saw the checks, the "top" cell the system found has a weird name like `$$$CONTEXT_INFO$$$`?

The precheck will replace the QR Code marker object with the real QRCode

Let's see what happens with the file we just uploaded and take it from there.

@peterkinget - It seems to have detected the top cell as `chip_top` for that.

Hopefully there will be a precheck run available for you when you wake up tomorrow

Nice

$$$CONTEXT_INFO$$$ is used by KLayout to store PCell information. See this discussion for more: https://www.klayout.de/forum/discussion/1060/compliance-check-export-stream
Please save the final layout without PCell information.

Compliance check export stream
We just overcome an issue about a user error causing an issue to open the exported gds in another GDS tool.

It looks like they must have done that with the final layout as that name is gone now.

Yes, we saved without the Pcell information for the latest submission.
