First, thank you all for being patient with us while we work through these initial teething problems!

The new deadline for DRC clean GDS is [17th Dec @ 11:59pm AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=wafer.space+GF180MCU+Run+%231+-+Clean+GDS+Submission+Deadline&iso=20251217T115959&p1=3901). Your GDS must be uploaded and have passed the precheck before this deadline. Given the upcoming end of year holidays, we don't expect the deadline to be extended again.

@Leo Moser (mole99) has made what are hopefully the last changes needed to both the gf180mcu-project-template and the gf180mcu-precheck. Please make sure you are using the latest versions of both of these resources and see the latest pinned comments in Discord in #project-template channel.

To help everyone meet the deadline, platform.wafer.space is being updated with a bunch of new ultra fast runners (Intel Core Ultra 7 265 Arrow Lake), allowing at least 14 prechecks to run at once.

We will continue to monitor discord and try to help @everyone as much as possible!","","waferspace (1),🔥 (1),👍 (1)"
