@everyone - If you are participating in the GF180MCU Run #1 shuttle you should have gotten an email about being added to a Google Group (either an invite or a directly added). This email group will get updates about the progress of the shuttle and other important information.

If you have **not** received the email and you think you are part of the shuttle, please reach out ASAP!
