@everyone 📢 The submission deadline has now passed!

Congratulations to everyone on the fantastic submissions.
If all goes well, the submission was the last active action required of you.

The next steps are as follows:

- We will stitch the reticle over the weekend. If we identify any violations that were not flagged by the precheck, we will contact you in time to resolve the issue.

- The final reticle will be stitched on Monday and sent to GF for validation. GF will then run their proprietary DRC deck on the reticle. If any violations are identified that were not caught by the open source DRC decks, we will contact you to resolve the issue.

We have rerun the latest precheck on all designs: some showed issues with the latest version 1.5.5. We have contacted the project authors, and they still have the opportunity to submit an updated design over the weekend.

If any of the other project authors catch a chip-breaking bug in their design, they will also have the chance to submit one final update - please only do so if it is important.

Now that the projects are submitted, please make sure to update:

- 📝 The project description.
- 🟩 The project visibility.
- 🌐 The project URL (if applicable).
- 🪪 And the project license.

This allows us to promote both wafer.space and all the great open source designs on this shuttle.
