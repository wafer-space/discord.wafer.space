So can upload things to it via newer openOCD , did upload Pci-leech and that works. Will see if I can register it as a board under Litex and make it do something. Next weekend will document the NeTV2 status in Litex Wiki. CH347 seems to be the easiest / cheapest UART + JTAG in the current setup.  Dirty JTAG's work too I guess. I have some Raspi's Pico's floating around looking for a purpose in life.","",""
