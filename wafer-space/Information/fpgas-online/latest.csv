    cmdline.txt and fstab had hardcoded 10.21.0.1 NFS server IPs.
    Convert to Jinja2 templates using {{ eth_local_address }} and
    {{ nfs_root }} so they work across sites with different IPs
    (e.g. welland at 10.31.0.3, PS1 at 10.21.0.1).

The IP address range 10.31.X.X is what I'm using for the fpgas.online in my network.","",""
