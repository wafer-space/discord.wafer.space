@Tisham Dhar (CSIRO EASI) - It should be pretty trivial to get the latest LitePCIe going on the NeTV2 once you have a working Vivado environment.


[01/21/2026 22:14] tishamdhar
I will get the Vivado going , then come back here. Last time AMD site would not let me register and download Vivado.

@Tisham Dhar (CSIRO EASI) - Yeah, know that feeling. It would be nice if f4pga was able to do LitePCIe -- https://github.com/openxc7 *might* be able to do it -- but I wouldn't start with that.

Overall though it points to a distribution challenge with FPGA / Litex toolchains. I am sure you are working on a solution.


[01/21/2026 22:20] tishamdhar
I remember I proposed docker instead of VM's long time ago, but at that time they were not hardware exposure friendly and images would be too big. Which is what we are trying to solve with FPGAs online, instead of distribution of toolchains we can let users come to a pre-installed stack.

Which for context is what I do in my day job, maintain science coding environments for astronomers and earth observation people.

I think packaging and distribution is still one of the unsolved problems in computer science 🙂
