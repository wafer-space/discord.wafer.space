This is a channel dedicated to the continued development of https://fpgas.online/ which has previously primarily been developed by @carlfk with the funding provided by @Tim 'mithro' Ansell 

The two current highest priority items for development are:
 * Getting all Tiny Tapeout boards onto the site in similar manner as existing Tiny Tapeout 6 board.
 * Getting @bunnie's NeTV2 boards into the site

Other lower priority items include:
 * Getting Tim's other FPGAs into the site, these include @Xobs's Fomu (Tim has pratically unlimited), @Greg's Butterstick (Tim has 8 devices) and @GoranMahovlic's ULX3S (Tim has ~12 devices), GreatScottGadget's Cythion (Tim has ~12 devices) hardware onto the site.
 * Actually using fpgas.online for testing open source FPGA projects.

If anyone has ideas on how to get more people to use the site, that is also something we are very interested in.

FYI - @Tisham Dhar (CSIRO EASI) / @carlfk / @logic destroyer / @Greg

@carlfk - @Tisham Dhar (CSIRO EASI) is looking at trying to get my NeTV2 hardware into https://fpgas.online

@carlfk - IIRC I left a bunch of NiteFury with RPi Compute modules and Compute Cluster blades with you?

@LukeW - @Tisham Dhar (CSIRO EASI) is having some issues with programming the NeTV2 using an RPi 5 because the GPIO have moved from the Broadcom device to the RP1 hardware. I believe the PIO hardware in the RP1 should allow us to do significantly better JTAG driver than what is currently in OpenOCD / openfpgaloader.

My stack looks like this now, since I am loading gateware using RPi 4 and accessing PCI-e from Rpi5

This is awesome! Way to go @carlfk! 
I've been seeing a lot of work being done here on other channels. Looking forward to seeing more.

I was having a thought the other day. 
I know that @logic destroyer ran a whole simulation of his new linux asic, and was curious what size FPGA you would need to do that same thing, and if that would even be applicable here. 
I assume that is something larger than you could load on to one of the ARTYboards?
