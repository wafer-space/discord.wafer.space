The two current highest priority items for development are:
 * Getting all Tiny Tapeout boards onto the site in similar manner as existing Tiny Tapeout 6 board.
 * Getting @bunnie's NeTV2 boards into the site

Other lower priority items include:
 * Getting Tim's other FPGAs into the site, these include @Xobs's Fomu (Tim has pratically unlimited), @Greg's Butterstick (Tim has 8 devices) and @GoranMahovlic's ULX3S (Tim has ~12 devices), GreatScottGadget's Cythion (Tim has ~12 devices) hardware onto the site.
 * Actually using fpgas.online for testing open source FPGA projects.

If anyone has ideas on how to get more people to use the site, that is also something we are very interested in.","","👍 (1),💜 (1)"

I know that @logic destroyer ran a whole simulation of his new linux asic, and was curious what size FPGA you would need to do that same thing, and if that would even be applicable here. 
I assume that is something larger than you could load on to one of the ARTYboards?","",""
