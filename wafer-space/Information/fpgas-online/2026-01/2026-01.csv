Seems they aren't up to the task.","",""

"169786952432746498","mithro_","2026-01-20T06:06:45.2260000+00:00","But really you want something like https://fires.im/ -- that makes the FPGA be an ASIC simulation accelerator","",""

"169786952432746498","mithro_","2026-01-20T06:10:04.5320000+00:00","The NeTV2 and NiteFury cards that @Tisham Dhar (CSIRO EASI) is playing with might be a good option for doing small firesim like stuff with the PCIe connection.","",""
"756011607603019777","anfroholic","2026-01-20T06:11:36.9010000+00:00","Gotcha, thanks. I *correctly* assumed they weren't quite sized for the task, but figured I'd ask anyways. 
Cool to see the toolchain exists!","",""
"169786952432746498","mithro_","2026-01-20T06:12:13.5930000+00:00","I mean, the designs you are doing on wafer.space probably are pretty reasonable to fit on the Arty / Netv2 / ULX3S sized FPGAs.","",""
"756011607603019777","anfroholic","2026-01-20T06:12:35.3380000+00:00","Oh! Amazing!!","",""
"169786952432746498","mithro_","2026-01-20T07:22:20.9790000+00:00","I'm guessing the NiteFury II mentioned @ https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Getting-Started-Guides/On-Premises-FPGA-Getting-Started/RHS-Research-Nitefury-II-FPGAs.html is probably Ultrascale+ based rather than Series 7 like the original Nitefury?","",""
