Just need to reverse engineer and open it.","",""

I'm guessing you have one of the special ""dev"" NeTV2 which had the 100T rather than the 35T part?","",""

And also has a PCIe ribbon cable M2 thingie or just an oculink connector at the edge.","",""

I have to setup litex and Vivado and all that jazz to compile gateware for the 100T and do a hello world and see.","",""
