Its reporting setup violations in the 100ns violations because an active design might change the output-enable or pull resistors or something on a IO pad, which triggers a change in the pad’s outputs to the core area, which kicks of timing paths through unrelated designs, which may also change output enables which changes pad outputs which triggers changes through the designs etc. etc. and so on. It ""bounces"" like that for up to 5 times before coming to a stop.","",""
