Eg, having an “announcements” or “rules” channel that anyone can post in (or allowing general discussion in “announcements”), rather defeats the purpose of having separate channels for announcements.

Most servers limit posting in those types of channels to a small set of pre-approved users.  Which also avoids getting spam in those channels.","",""
