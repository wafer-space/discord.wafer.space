It could be a bit dangerous to use it as such, as they may change with time. For example, if some error is found in the precheck and there's a need to update it and rerun the check, the files may not be same anymore.
A simple fix would be to encourage users to update files that are commit-referred instead, like `github.com/[...]/blob/39306415f62fd6e74851dbc5f0dc57ea608af3f3/[...]`, which are static","",""
