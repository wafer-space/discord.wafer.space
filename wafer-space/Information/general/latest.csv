Yes, there are updates: There were some issues with missing metal slots in some designs, mostly on the logos. The project authors have been notified and asked to review the updated layouts with the generated metal slots.
I submitted the updated reticle yesterday evening, so GF had it first thing on Monday morning.

We'll let you know as soon as we hear back from GF.","","❤️ (2)"

It depends on how the deadlines are spaced on GF's side.","",""
