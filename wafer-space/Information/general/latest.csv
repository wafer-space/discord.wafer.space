What I found in the docs:

- https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_03.html

> 3.4 Consistent layout all designs on a 0.005μm grid will avoid off-grid and snapping issues during database fracturing.

- https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_07_02.html

> The design grid must be an integer multiple of 0.005μm.

Given the wording of the second statement, and that DRC errors in the design can lead to a back and forth with GF, it is probably safer and simpler to assume that all shapes on all layers need to be on the 5nm grid.

As for the angle checks, I would actually love to be able to draw arbitrary angles (except for acute and as long as all points are on-grid). However, given the wording in the docs I'm not sure about this.

- https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_05_1.html

> SH.2: Avoid any COMP, poly and metal shapes with acute angles (angles <90 deg). Exceptions are only for pre-tested metal inductors with IND_MK mark layers and lettering (non circuit elements).

This would tell me that arbitrary angles (except acute) are allowed on these layers.

However this is contradicted by:

https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/physical_verification/design_manual/drm_03.html

> 3.6 Only 90 deg and 45 deg bends are allowed for poly and metal lines.

I wouldn't even dare to guess what this means for other layers 🤷‍♂️","","👍🏻 (1)"
