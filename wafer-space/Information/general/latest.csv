```
Here is a history of this Efuse compiler:
1. Originally the compiler was made in haste for the GFMPW-0 run. My chip with a 9 kBit Efuse block was accepted by Efabless, but unfortunately there was no full chip LVS available in Efabless tapeout flow at the time. So I've missed a critical flaw in this chip - VDD & GND stripes in Efuse blocks were not connected to top level power stripes. The only missing thing were vias connecting stripes on Metal5 to stripes on Metal4.
2. After discovering the power issue I thought there would be no hope to verify the Efuse block in this chip so when the chips arrived I tested mostly other parts of the chip. Efuse was dead as expected, but Caravel and some of my digital test structures worked flawlessly with VDD in range from 3 to 8 Volts which amazed me. GF180MCU seems to be a really robust process :).
3. For the GFMPW-1 I've submitted a chip with fixed power connections problem and introduced several small improvements in Efuse macro, but my chip was not selected for the run.
4. As missing top metal vias was the only thing standing between my curiosity and testing Efuse on GFMPW-0 chips, I thought that maybe it's possible to create vias on finished chips somehow. Some time ago I've got a contact of guys from chip testing industry from a friend, and they agreed to create a couple of vias for me.
5. After chip decap and vias creation on two of Efuse subblocks these subblocks miraculously just worked. I had no single write (one time obviously) or read error on all efuse bytes that were powered during several days I've tested this chip.
6. As I thought that accessible GF180 runs would never happen again I kinda lost the motivation in improving the compiler, but now if there is such a possibility I would like to make it useful.

There is of course the existing pad frame from the GFMPW shuttles at Efabless, which is going to be used for the first wafer.space shuttle run.

I'm working on an OpenROAD.PadRing step for IHP, which should work for GF as well, since the IO pads are really not that complicated (compared to e.g. sky130...).

If @tnt uses the same script to create the I/O cell positions as for Tiny Tapeout on IHP, this would be compatible with the LibreLane padring generation step.

We just need to think how we can improve the script when we have differently sized cells, or cells with two bondpads. But luckily, the I/O cells in gf180mcu all have the same size again.

You would need to enter the I/O cell names and the instances similar to [here](https://github.com/mole99/greyhound-ihp/blob/dd7334364b053c3a0b52e81fc34a8fffb9808f5f/config.yaml#L162). But I think in your script you automatically place the I/O cells based on the instances?

Currently, because all cells have the same width, both is the case. (Might not be that relevant for TT, but I would like to make the LibreLane padring step future-proof.)

I would go for the latter. With the first approach there is the issue that you can't go as tight because a larger cell might already be touching its neighbours while the other cells still have space. If there are cells with two bondpads, such as for LVDS, it becomes difficult to ensure the same distance between all the bondpads anyways.","",""

But it's just a matter of figuring out how to configure LibreLane with these stdcells.

For now, Tamas used a nice trick to get separate power domains using custom breaker cells, see: https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-gf-0p1/blob/main/docs/padframe.svg
However, if we have proper power/ground cells for both domains then we wouldn't have to resort to such tricks.

If you have a PR ready just ping me and I can give it a try. We need to make sure that the pin shape for the bondpad comes first in the LEF, so that OpenROAD will promote the correct pin to a BTerm.

I was looking at what fits in the size / node you have , and I saw this paper.
 https://sbmicro.org.br/sforum-eventos/sforum2021/Design%20of%20Steel%20ASIC,%20a%20RISC-V%20processor.pdf

They say they used 15mm2 for the STEEL core at 180nm. 

Not a silicon guy, the nosey embedded SW eng from the live stream here. So excuse my naivete. 

Anyways that looks quite large ish? Is it true that you need that much die area for a simple RISC-V core? Using Claude to get ballpark  estimates, I was wondering if I can fit an IBEX in the area you have and the IBEX is larger than the STEEL. 

Can I eyeball what fits with some  gates/mm2 formula?","",""

- QSPI flash chip and QSPI PSRAM chip on separate interfaces

- Hazard3 Risc-V core in a similar config to RP2350, but single core
That should leave a decent amount of space (maybe 1/3 of the area) for peripherals and custom logic, but enough cache and RAM to give OK performance.  I'd target 3v3 so that it was easy to interface with standard QSPI chips, and hope to get it running at 30MHz.","",""

Fuse material is not melted per se but is “moved” by electromigration after all. I'm not by any means an expert in technology myself, but the only requirement that is present in open source DRM is that there should be no metal1 and metal2 above the fuse. I understand that the opensource DRM and DRC rules could be incomplete in rarely used aspects like eFuse, but during OpenMPW-GF0 my chip with the eFuse block adhering to these rules was accepted and manufactured, so I guess it passed an official factory DRC with Calibre or something. Unfortunately that chip had a fatal flaw with the power supply for eFuse which I missed due to device level LVS being absent from the tapeout script for GF180 at that time, and the fixed chip was not accepted for the GF1 run. The only way to test the eFuse on the GF0 chip was by decapping it and restoring eFuse power one way or another. I’ve sent @Tim 'mithro' Ansell some of my GF0 chips and described this powering and testing procedure in detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9qWxHJzb4RIqjDzd3Dr9FddIsH_DiyjSaHewqEm0X4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.oi68oexfhjcr).","",""

But I’ve personally tested a single chip patched this way earlier. If I remember correctly, there were 128 bits of eFuse powered, around half of which I’ve blown writing something semi-random. I had only about a day to test the chip remotely, but during this whole time period (apart from several power downs to ensure nonvolatility) eFuse was constantly being read from Caravel in cycles and all the bits kept their state. 128 bits and one day is a tiny sample for sure, but due to constant reading each bit was sensed around a billion times which is quite a lot for a eFuse and there were 0 read errors. I understand that unless someone repeats this patching procedure, there is only my word about this short testing to trust here, but personally I am sure that it works to some extent. Fuses definitely do not solidify back in place, at least most of them do not as none of my ~64 programmed ones did. A couple of days ago I was contacted by Jonas Svennebring who is planning to lead the effort of creating a chip for testing several IPs to be launched on the first wafer.space run. We agreed to work on putting several eFuse memory blocks created with my updated eFuse compiler to characterize eFuse performance and reliability. So hopefully we’ll have more reliable information about eFuse after the first wafer.space chips arrive. If anyone has some knowledge which could help to make eFuse more reliable or could help in any other way I would be very grateful.","",""

But probably these are some other fuses, cause layer numbers do not match eFuse ones and it mentions ""Top plate of MIM capacitors"". As my chip was manufactured during GF0 I assumed that the mask (masks?) necessary for eFuse was present during the run, not sure if it was ordered separately or was included by default. @Tim 'mithro' Ansell do you have a way to check with GF if eFuse masks will be available during planned wafer.space run?

Although an eFuse cell has a limited number of read cycles (~10^7-10^9 depending on technology and a testing methodology based on open info) which makes it unsuitable for such tasks directly, it's quite easy to create an eFuse-SRAM hybrid. By copying whole eFuse contents to SRAM after powerup and reading only from SRAM afterwards it's possible to mitigate this limitation for read-heavy uses. Drawbacks are obvious: higher power, startup delay and ~1.5x lower density than a raw eFuse. But I estimate that it's still possible to achieve a density of ~6 kbits/mm^2 which makes small MCU ROMs feasible. Especially because if I'm not mistaken it's currently the only option for post-fabrication programmable ROM.","",""

I have worked with laser trim fuses and efuses (in the long past---around 2007 or so), and I was conflating the two.  Laser trim fuses require a passivation window over the device, because the laser evaporates the material, which must have somewhere to go or it just melts and resolidifies, as I said.  But yes, eFuses involve the electromigration of the salicide off the top of the poly and are a different mechanism entirely.

The GF manual, as usual, is very difficult to read and does not help things at all by variously referring to the ""eFuse"", the ""polyfuse"", metal fuses, and OTP.  I still have not figured out what they mean by OTP.  However, by looking at the device/layer truth table, it looks to me like ""polyfuse"" and metal fuses both require a window and therefore one extra mask, whereas I don't see that the eFuse requires any additional mask, and is simply defined by a number of marker layers.","","👍 (1)"

It's much easier to change the version of individual tools, you can create an environment that is reproducible, and you get the best performance :)

Of course, but that also means you only know if the project reaches the funding goal at the last minute. With the usual crowdfunding model (where projects without sufficient funding are cancelled), that means people have to commit to spending time and resources without knowing if they can actually have the designs produced.

On-chip circuits are usually meant to drive microamps, not milliamps.  Driving an off-chip load does require some beefy components, but with the right amp design, you can restrict the beefy components to just the output driver, and most of the rest of the amplifier will be reasonbly small.  A voltage follower is generally easier to get working than an inverting amplifier (all the drive current goes to the load), so it's probably a good idea to look closely at what's causing that configuration to fail.  Finally, a current bias is much better than a voltage bias, and if it's really taking a voltage bias, then you shouldn't need a milliamp current path through your voltage divider to set it.","",""

We, ISHI-KAI( https://ishi-kai.org/links ), are a community that promotes open source PDK & EDA in Japan.  
This time, we brought together 14 novice semiconductor designers (most of whom were new to semiconductor design), each of whom created an analog circuit, such as an Inverter or OPAMP, ADC, PLL, BGR, CS, made using xschem & klayout with P-Cells for Wafer.Space GF180MCU .  
All schematics and layouts are released under an open source license.

Firstly, my custom 3.3V standard cells (including IO pad structures for 3.3V IO). Secondly, a general-purpose, easy to use toolset for creating multi-project dies. I want to make it as simple as defining a project list in a CSV and dropping it plus the source RTL for each project into a repository template, and the whole multiplexer and top-level setup is auto-generated. It would not be as advanced as TinyTapeout, but more dynamic. Better for when the die is only to be split 4 or 5 ways, with each project having a variable size, so you can do crazy splits like a 3 project die where 90% of available area goes to to project #1 and 5% to #2 and #3 each.
For bonus points, I may create a GUI for managing the project list, settings and macro arrangement.","","👏 (2),🎉 (1)"

I was hoping to finish layout at the end of last week, but it ran over into the weekend.  I now have a draft layout, DRC clean, but I have not run LVS yet (will work on that tomorrow)  The design is currently about 300 x 330 um, which makes it just slightly less than 1/2 the area of the 5V SRAM.  I have some room to shave off additional area from the bottom.  I can probably get it down to 300 x 300, but probably don't have time to do that for this tapeout.  Once I get it LVS clean, I will push the layout, netlist, and LEF.  Adjusting all the timing in the liberty and verilog files will take a lot of time and effort.","","👏 (3),🎉 (4)"

If you're as innocent as me, you might think that the meaning of the SRAM control signals is as follows:

-    CEN = Chip Enable
-    GWEN = Global Write Enable
-    WEN = Write Enable

Far from it! The real meaning is actually:

-    CEN = Chip Enable Negative
-    GWEN = Global Write Enable Negative
-    WEN = Write Enable Negative

All of the control signals need to be negated. (I would have preferred CEB, GWEB and WEB...)

Another pitfall: in order for the SRAM model to work, it needs to see a falling edge on CEN. Therefore, you cannot start the simulation with CEN low.

Thank you for your attention 😄","","⁉️ (2)"
