Now I need an asynchronous set/reset flop in addition to the tristate inverter.  If you haven't worked on the tristate buffer at all, then I will probably try to do both of those tomorrow, along with any others that might be useful (oai?  nand4/nor4?).  But probably just the flops and tristate inverter will get me through synthesis.","",""
