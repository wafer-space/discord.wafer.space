When we finish doing shuttle slot assignments there might be empty space that something which is manufacturable on the platform would end up getting put into. 

Paying obviously gets you ahead of the queue when slot assignments happen.

At the moment there /may/ be some 1×0.5 (Half Height) slots that we end up looking for things to put in.

There is also the chance that some people don't end up delivering manufacturable stuff which means we have more open slots which need to be filled.","",""
