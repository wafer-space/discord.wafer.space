If you run the flow on this with its exact config, it’ll fail GLP with `[GPL-0305] RePlAce diverged during gradient descent calculating, resulting in an invalid step length (inf or NaN).` but if the max fanout constraint in the config is changed from 7 to 6, it passes (before failing due to routing congestion).
Maybe also a fun benchmark case.","general_media/example.tar-E5614.gz",""
