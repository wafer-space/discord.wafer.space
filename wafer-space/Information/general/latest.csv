Be careful when you do that, because it will also try to relabel everything according to the ports in the LEF file.  That may be what you want, then again, it might not.","",""

I had similar issues with antenna violations within the macros of our design. You could try to get the librelane dev version with
```
nix shell github:librelane/librelane/dev
```
and then run the synthesis flow with
```make
librelane librelane/config.yaml --pdk ${PDK} --pdk-root ${PDK_ROOT}
```.
Set PDK_ROOT to some directory and then Librelane should download the PDK. At least for me this yielded better results that helped me debug the design","",""
