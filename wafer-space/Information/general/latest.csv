I still have not worked on the power connections and there are other issues, and the whole thing is under-utilizing the space, but it is good progress!","general_media/caravel_openframe-01168.png","❤️ (1),🎉 (1)"

But for the record, you are missing the verilog for the two new cells (my version, attached).  Also, I noticed in the update that you renamed ""decap"" cells to ""fillcap"";  however, the setup file for LibreLane still calls out ""decap"" for the cells.","general_media/gf180mcu_as_sc_mcu7t3v3__dfsrtp_2-19816.v,general_media/gf180mcu_as_sc_mcu7t3v3__invz_2-7954E.v",""
