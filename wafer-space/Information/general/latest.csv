I guess you could just do a bunch of wirebonds between neighbors","",""

 I was noodling over some future projects that could be meshed with 1000 chips, and was like ""why don't I just leave them all on the wafer?"" 😇   I'm sure there are tons of weird issues like power distribution and timing and such, but could be a fun way to abuse an older node like 180nm","","waferspace (1)"
