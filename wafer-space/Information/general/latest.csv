If you are doing it as an academic/learning exercise or for prototyping or otherwise, it could still make sense to do.

Also doing a bitcoin miner isn't an easy task, I would not recommend it be your first ASIC or tapeout. You are not going to do a full miner with Tiny Tapeout (but you might be able to test some small parts of it with Tiny Tapeout). Start with something small and easy.","",""
