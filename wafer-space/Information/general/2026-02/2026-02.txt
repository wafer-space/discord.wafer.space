grain of salt: I'm an absolute newbie here, and no experience with proprietary tools. but for 2), I think the biggest help would be really thorough documentation of common "knobs" that a designer might need to tune. What the parameter does, how it interacts with other parts of the system, when you might need to tune a specific parameter, what ranges are reasonable, guides about how to think about parameter tweaking ("try A first, then try B, but be careful because it might affect XYZ"). Some of this exists but it's pretty sparse in places. 

I.e. material to help with self-directed troubleshooting, rather than direct support (which scales poorly anyway).

As an example, I pretty blindly messed with all the margin parameters until I found combinations that worked, only to later learn that manual ECO steps exist and I could maybe have targeted specific areas of the circuit. Ditto to learning late in the project that 9T cells were an option and fixed a lot of my timing/congestion issues.

Or that different SRAM macro placement locations/orientations could seriously impact PVT corners.

Or how to load up DRC violations and inspect them manually, and strategies for fixing them.

All of that seems very obvious in hindsight, but it was _a huge_ learning curve to get up to speed with since documentation is kinda all over the place. And there is a big lack of "best practice" style guides

tl;dr: the wafer.space project template was amazing for "push button get GDS", but as a newbie it took a long time to figure out how to tweak things to fit my specific design 🙂 More robust docs about how OpenRoad/LibreLane works in that regard would really help

People who are interested in adder optimization might find https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cta.70336 interesting.
