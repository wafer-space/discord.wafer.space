I am working on the OpenROAD   Initiative (https://openroadinitiative.org/) to support open-source EDA tools. @Tim 'mithro' Ansell suggested I reach out here to get your feedback on two questions:

What are the trade-offs of using open-source tools vs. commercial tools?
What level of support do you expect from open-source tools (community, dedicated team, etc.)?

I really appreciate your responses! We’ll use your input to fine-tune our approach in improving usability and reducing costs for chip designers. Thanks in advance!","",""
