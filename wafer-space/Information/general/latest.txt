Interesting! You made a dedicated instruction for those? Are you supporting IEEE 754 floats?

Yep, sorta! My processor is a transport-triggered architecture, so it's relatively easy to bolt on additional functional units (just adds a new move destination/result to the bus). iirc the tanh is set to use Q1.15 fixed point, and I think the MAC is just simple wrapping integer (edit: yep)

those particular FUs got basically zero testing and were thrown in the last week, so dunno if they work 🤷 😅

(I'm using Spade HDL and did zero optimization here, so it's also just whatever the transpiler spit out and then yosys generated using defaults. i'm sure they are horrible at the transistor level 🫣 )

Hey, we're not *that* awful :p

It's kind of funny to think of my chess move generator in CPU terms :p

I'm not *entirely* sure it counts as a TTA, but it has things that could be considered such
