Wait


[12/06/2025 01:48] tholin
I messed something up


[12/06/2025 01:48] tholin
There is traces and standard cells clipping into my silicon art


[12/06/2025 01:48] tholin
That is a big yikes


[12/06/2025 01:49] tholin
Besides the DRC errors this brings, wanna bet its responsible for the false antenna positives?


[12/06/2025 01:51] rtimothyedwards_19428
Maybe.  Top level metal is rarely involved in antenna violations because it is almost guaranteed to be connected to diffusion somewhere.  The only way to go is down.

I may or may not have duplicated the artwork pixels onto every metal layer, as well as Poly2


[12/06/2025 02:07] tholin
I have a fillblock over every piece of artwork because I am afraid of the fillers messing it up visually. So that’s why the artwork is on every layer. To prevent minimum density violations.

The art IS my fill pattern!

I have to run very soon, but it looks like the prechecks are running okay on platform (even if there is still a bit of a queue) and are detecting antenna issues now?


[12/06/2025 02:13] mithro_
I didn't get a chance to deploy the functionality which lets me crank the number of simultaneous prechecks up yet but I think that will happen today.

Also if you haven't already seen, there is a great post from Matt Venn @ https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/post/excited_by_silicon/ about his thoughts on the state of open silicon.

Excited by silicon!
I was recently asked what excites me most about the exploding open-source silicon ecosystem. Honestly? It depends who’s asking.
For one person I might talk about Basilisk - the PULP team’s seriously impressive Linux-capable RISC-V core. For another, maybe the new GF180mcu MPW from Wafer.Space, or the millions in funding finally flowing into ...

I feel like I am far behind in the race, but at least I got LibreLane to give me GDS of a synthesized layout of my 3.3V picoRV32 in a mixed voltage padframe using my SRAM and I/O and Tholin's standard cells (thanks, Tholin!).  I still have not worked on the power connections and there are other issues, and the whole thing is under-utilizing the space, but it is good progress!

@Tholin :  FYI:  I pulled your latest standard cell updates and obviously they worked because otherwise I would not have produced the pic above.  But for the record, you are missing the verilog for the two new cells (my version, attached).  Also, I noticed in the update that you renamed "decap" cells to "fillcap";  however, the setup file for LibreLane still calls out "decap" for the cells.
