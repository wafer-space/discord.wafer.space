Hello, everyone
I'm a senior full-stack engineer in the AI/ML field. I have extensive development and practical experience in various fields, including frontend, backend, AI/ML-based customer-facing and generative AI projects, chatbot development, CEO capacity building, MCP server construction, test system development tailored to educational environments, and AI adoption in the medical field.
I hesitated to post this on Discord, fearing it might seem like self-promotion, but I believe my skills and experience can contribute, even if only slightly, to the advancement of human civilization and future education, so I'm posting it.
My technology stack is as follows: 
> Frontend & Backend Engineering : React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, relational databases, Full-stack architecture design and API
> Machine Learning & AI Frameworks : TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, JAX, XGBoost, classical ML pipelines, OpenCV for computer vision, Model evaluation, optimization
> Cloud, MLOps & Platforms : AWS SageMaker, AWS AI Services, Google ML Engine, Apache Airflow, DataRobot, Scalable training, inference, and monitoring pipelines
> Generative AI & Applied AI: OpenAI API, Meta AI Platform, IBM Watson, LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Generative text & code generation, Chatbots and conversational AI, Text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to audio systems, AI Art tools and creative AI pipelines, Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, voice cloning, Real-time translation systems
If this feels like self-promotion, feel free to delete it.
