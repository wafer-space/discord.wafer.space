However, this was designed to fit in the existing I/O cells, not the standard cells, so it's not pitch-matched to any standard cell library.  To level-shift down, I generally just use a 5V inverter powered at 3.3V, although if you want it matched to a standard cell library, then the 5V rail should bias the nwell (which will be connected to other 5V standard cell nwells) and the 3.3V supply to the inverter should be a separate pin.","",""
