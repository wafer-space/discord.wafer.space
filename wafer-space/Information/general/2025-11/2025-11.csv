```
module falsepath_anchor (
    input  wire i,
    output wire z
);

`ifdef GF180MCU

(* keep *)
gf180mcu_fd_sc_mcu9t5v0__clkbuf_1 magic_falsepath_anchor_u (
    .I (i),
    .Z (z)
);

`else

assign z = i;

`endif

endmodule

```

and then just glob them out in the `.sdc`:

```
# Apply RTL-inserted false path constraints (setup/hold only, still constrain slew)
set_false_path -setup -hold -through [get_pins *.magic_falsepath_anchor_u/Z]
```

It's dirty but it makes the constraints a bit less fragile because you don't have to update them when hierarchy changes. Also I think paths through PD/PU can pretty much universally be falsepathed as the slew on the pad due to pulls is so slow.","",""
