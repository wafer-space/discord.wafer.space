I have twenty 512x8 blocks, and my current setup is a ring around the logic cells. Pretty sure I have them all backwards at the moment though, and I have a bunch of slew/cap violations at the moment (and some other broken stuff too)

Seeing how little logic there actually is, I might condense the blocks closer to help with timing issues","general_media/image_black-51CB7.png",""
