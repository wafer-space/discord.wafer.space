@Andrew Wingate - You seem to understand discord enough to make that happen?

Specifically making the "admin"-like channels (eg, #announcements  and #welcome-and-rules ) limited to admins (and other specifically approved people) to post.    That'd also avoid announcements turning into a discussion channel, obscuring the announcements (which has happened at least once already).
