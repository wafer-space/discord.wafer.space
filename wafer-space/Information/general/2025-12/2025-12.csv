However, for building the macros we are using the `dev` branch of LibreLane and the ""classic"" flow. For the top-level build, we are using the LibreLane version from the nix-shell and the ""chip"" flow. From our POV this seems to work better for the macros in terms of timing and antenna violations. However, tbh, we do not really understand why. But there is nothing against this approach, right? 😅","",""

Some tips to help though would be to move pins of your modules to Met3/Met4 instead of Met2/Met3 so the pins acts as antenna straps. And also try to avoid routing on Met5.","",""
