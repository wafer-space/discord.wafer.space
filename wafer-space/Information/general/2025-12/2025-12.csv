Due to the patch KLayout needs to recompile when invoking the Nix shell.","","👍 (1)"

Well, hopefully we *do* get violations if they are above the limit 😄","",""

"596068704471482370","246tnt","2025-12-07T14:06:57.7540000+00:00","Yeah, knowing if there are actual violations or not is harder 😅 
Although TBH, given the massive multiplier of 15, it'd be quite challenging to get a violation when any diode is involved. On 3v3 designs, that'd be more likely so maybe Tim will see some in his designs.","",""

The last commit should fix all remaining DPF.1 violations.
Then, we'll see if we can still meet the density limits for all designs...","",""
"323371864074485771","mole99","2025-12-07T14:17:14.9580000+00:00","Another issue is that some designs take multiple hours for the KLayout antenna check. I think there's something going wrong. I checked the connectivity setup for potential shorts, but I don't see how this can happen for some designs but not for others.","",""
