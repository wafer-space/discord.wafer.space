I generally have the LEF writer not add via blockages (I probably should rethink that), but in this case it's needed.  I added it to the OBS list:
```
LAYER Via1
  RECT 13.645 1.690 13.905 1.950 ;
```
which worked fine (no DRC errors generated during routing).  Not sure if it makes more sense to put it under the SN pin PORT record.  I think I can have magic output via records where vias are sitting inside a port boundary.  Until then, these lines have to be added manually.","",""
