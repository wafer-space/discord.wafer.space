SID is pretty much The Holy Grail when it comes to replicas. Relatively 😉 large demand, relatively expensive and hard to emulate correctly.
SID has bunch of analog components inside - amps, filters and DACs. All with pretty unique characteristics.

GF180 is prefect for such a replica!","",""

Wafer.Space will be ideal for the whole chip tapeout.","",""
