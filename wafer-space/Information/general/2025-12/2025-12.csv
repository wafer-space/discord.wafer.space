"596068704471482370","246tnt","2025-12-08T07:44:48.3360000+00:00","And does it also report the raw values ( perimeters / gate area / diode area and such as details in each violation ) ?","",""
"709384666909507634","egorxe","2025-12-08T07:50:04.1510000+00:00","For now version in the PR only marks the violating gates, no nets even. AFAIU all raw values could be made available in GDS properties, but I'm not sure how to output them to lyrdb. Do you suggest to save them always, or just to create some ""debug mode""?","",""
