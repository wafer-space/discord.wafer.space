There is currently no way to ""pay"" for a half slot. Basically you need to have something on the platform.wafer.space site which is manufacturable at the time of assignment.","",""

The exact details are still unknown and depends on lots of different things and unclear if it is even worth the hassle for there to be options to pay something to get more and such.","",""
