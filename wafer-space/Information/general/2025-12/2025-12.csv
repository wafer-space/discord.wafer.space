 (1) Finish the https://platform.wafer.space deployment.
 (2) Bed.
 (3) Check how things have gone and evaluate an what the update should be.

Given the timeline, I'll probably port across any green prechecks on the https://test-platform.wafer.space to prod platform.","",""

I'm guessing they paid GF for GF180MCU too, which probably means that we won't get any new open source nodes unless someone else steps up and pays for it?","",""
