Depending on how long that list is, I can’t promise I’ll get to all of it, but I can try.","",""

As far as I know, my only issue with it right now is that you were using variable PAD_CELL_LIBRARY in your librelane setup file, which is apparently incompatible with the dev version of librelane.  I was able to work around it by deleting those lines from the setup file (I'm not including pad cells in my synthesis anyway, for now), but it needs some future-proof fix.  Apart from that, I assume I could get a better synthesis if I had additional cells like a half-adder, full-adder, 4-input basic logic gates, and more variations of OAI cells.  And a slow corner liberty file would be good.  But the library is usable as-is.","",""
