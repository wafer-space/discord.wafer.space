I have picked up a couple of EX63 hetzner servers with Intel Core Ultra 7 265 Arrow Lake and 192GB memory to run the prechecks. 

AI says they are 4,663 single threaded performance compared to the current 1,200 single threaded performance. 

I'm just working on testing everything with test-platform.wafer.space before deploying it to the production platform.wafer.space","",""
