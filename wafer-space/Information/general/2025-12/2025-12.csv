These are just guesses. It would be nice to know if anything made a difference.

If it does, you might try the `DIODE_ON_PORTS` parameter. 

If those are fanout related, make sure `DESIGN_REPAIR_TIE_FANOUT` is set to true.

Maybe adjust the `DESIGN_REPAIR_MAX_CAP_PCT` setting. Maybe counter-intuitive, but a higher setting may decrease the ratio by increasing the gate area. On the other hand, a lower setting may, decrease the wiring area.","",""
