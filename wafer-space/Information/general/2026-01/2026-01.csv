So if you draw PCOMP and NCOMP only you need to generate the N+/P+ out of it with the right sizing plus filling of small spaces. This become quite complicated and even pretty difficult for two corner that are diagonallly too closo to each other. I prefer that PDKs allow me to draw COMP and N+/P+ separately and decide myself which N+/P+ regions to join into one.","","💯 (1)"
