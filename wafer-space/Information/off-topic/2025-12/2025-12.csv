"384390069412429834","polyfractal","2025-12-13T17:19:16.0990000+00:00","or do you have to go and buy a full wafer from the fab at more modern nodes?","",""

"384390069412429834","polyfractal","2025-12-13T18:23:44.0660000+00:00","hah yeah that's fair. especially for older nodes, it's not like there's a lot of cutting edge IP that could be reverse engineered there... presumably the industry knows all the tricks already and has applied it to the latest nodes","",""
