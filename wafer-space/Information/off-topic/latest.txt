Folks, we have a select group of people here in this wafer.space community who might be interested in this, and @Tim 'mithro' Ansell maybe this would be of interest to you for various reasons in your current explorations...Will Salcedo, who worked with us on customer design support for a while at Efabless, is developing GPU & AI acceleration for OpenLane. This is a blurb about their work:

Will Salcedo (https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-salcedo/) and Vamshi Balangala (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamshibalanaga/) are building enhanced EDA tools on top of OpenLane that improve the speed, scalability, and quality of existing open-source tools. We are using GPU-accelerated approaches and AI to get at least 100x runtime improvements over legacy tools. If you are struggling with closing out designs, we would love to help you get to tapeout faster.

Will and Vamshi are hoping to find people interested in what they're doing, and possibly willing to experiment with what they've done so far, so if anyone would be prepared to at least reach out to them and find out more, please let me know. From what Will was telling me, their approach was to greatly accelerate parts of the resizing/repair, with the intent initially of doing far greater design-space exploration (since for larger designs or extreme timing/density requirements, this can often be a bottleneck). They have also contemplated adapting their work to things like IR drop analysis.

It sounds interesting (and a few of us at Efabless started talking to them late 2024 and it was already showing promise then), and I'm just sharing this around as a favour.

NOTE: I'm not sure yet whether their offering is intended to be open-source or at least include an open-source option.

nominal material thickness is 1/8" I can change it if needed


[04/29/2025 02:22] carlfk
if it is less, like cereal box cardboard, that's fine right?  the tabs won't be snug, but I can sitll goop hotglue all over the plance it will mostly work


[04/29/2025 02:33] anfroholic
I mean, I can change the thickness, so if it's as thick as cereal box, it's fine. tab sizes will just auto-change too


[04/29/2025 03:04] carlfk
in case John is short on time and grabs whatever material is handy, wnated to make sure thinner is ok


[04/29/2025 03:04] carlfk
thicker I will have to turn the holes into notches - no biggie

We ran a bunch more tests. Maybe slightly better results with the 355 but not enough to justify investments so far


[04/29/2025 06:20] digshadow
I did get a lot better with the software options and might be able to improve my 1064 nanometer flow. Some evidence also suggest that I don't have my existing 355 nanometer fiber laser setup ideally, so I might also give that another pass

Do you really need 4 ground pins ? 😅


[10/01/2025 18:27] rebelmike
That's ~1mm^2?  Makes it obvious why I was wondering about just having pins on a single side, you could probably fit 11 of the 12 pins while massively increasing the core area


[10/01/2025 18:29] mole99
Who doesn't? 😄  No, that was just a quick chip for creating a reproducible for Tim E.


[10/01/2025 18:34] mole99
Yes, the ratio between padring and core is massive in this case. You might be able to use the LibreLane padring script as a starting point to adjust the padring to only a single side. If this is already possible in OpenROAD today, I can then adjust the default script to allow this directly.

Needing this is a little way off as we'd need to have options to subdivide the dies first, but it's on my list of things to play with at some point 🙂


[10/01/2025 18:48] mole99
Well, you can already subdivide a die yourself and submit several of your sub-dies at once.
The individual dies won't be separated, of course, but we should still be able to bond the ones around the edges 😉

I think you can team up with @RebelMike  and share a subdivided die 😁


[10/01/2025 19:36] tholin
I don't know what I would even put on there


[10/01/2025 19:37] tholin
Something I²C, I guess?


[10/01/2025 19:38] urish
USB


[10/01/2025 19:39] tholin
That sounds like a challenge. Doesn't that require precise timing? Out of a ring oscillator?


[10/01/2025 19:39] urish
(Precisely Clocking 12 MHz internally is a challenge left to the reader)


[10/01/2025 19:40] tholin
I mean, how does the USB protocol work? Surely, there is some pre-defined discovery packet that is sent by the host? That could be used to tune the ring oscillator.


[10/01/2025 19:40] urish
ATtiny85's internal RC osc can somehow manage USB


[10/01/2025 19:41] tholin
Oh, yeah, USB packets literally start with a bunch of even pulses as a clock sync.


[10/01/2025 19:42] tholin
But not sure how you'd tune a ring oscilator off of that


[10/01/2025 19:42] tholin
THAT I will leave as a challenge to the reader

{Reactions}
😉

[10/01/2025 19:43] urish
I guess you could also try to get a clock through VDD somehow


[10/01/2025 19:44] urish
like swing it between 3V and 3V3 at 12MHz (or whatever you need), and then use that internally to generate the clock


[10/01/2025 19:45] urish
an easy-ish way to create it would be to connect the VDD pin to the power supply through a FET in parallel with a diode


[10/01/2025 19:45] urish
then you feed the clock to the FET, and whenever the FET is off, the voltage will drop by the diode forward voltage drop


[10/01/2025 19:48] rebelmike
We have OTP, right?  So, you first start in a mode where you can blow OTP bits somehow to tune the ring oscillator.  Then once that's within tolerances you blow a bit that permanently turns the device into a USB


[10/01/2025 19:48] tholin
One way a ring oscillator could be made tuneable is by using transmission gates to bypass some of the inverters. Have one path that goes through the inverters and one path that goes around them. I'm not sure if that'll provide ultra fine control, but it doesn't need to be perfect. The clock only needs to line up with the USB data bits for one packet before the next one re-tunes the oscillator.


[10/01/2025 19:48] tholin
Okay, now I'll stop!


[10/01/2025 19:49] tholin
(The idea of using a NFET and DAC as a digitally controllable impedance to speed down the oscillator also occured to me, but I'm not sure how well that'd work, actually)


[10/01/2025 19:51] tholin
Not really feasible, since you need to dynamically account for drift of the oscillator by supply voltage and temperature.


[10/01/2025 20:41] mithro_
Reminds me of some very old 4 pin PIC10F devices which had a shared GPIO/VDD pin and a large internal capacitor with specs of how long you could pull the GPIO line low.....


[10/01/2025 20:42] mithro_
PLL on the USB packet with oscillator as initial frequency input is how the SiLab HappyGecko parts are able to meet spec without an external crystal

[10/03/2025 22:12] mithro_
I guess depends on how you define that -- @carlfk put the Tiny Tapeout board on the internet but I think that is cheating. I wonder if you could run ppp over the uart to the Linux core.....


[10/03/2025 22:13] tholin
Due to the fact that dial-up modems once existed, you can actually pipe a network connection over UART to this day with some basic Linux utilities.


[10/03/2025 22:17] mithro_
@Tholin - I think the Tiny Tapeout Linux core might be too slow? I think there are some real time requirements for PPP? I've forgotten what was the thing that we used before PPP.

It's true until it's not. I have a bit of a bias since I'm kind of a keller fanboy, but I really don't understand the industry enough to make an educated guess.


[10/24/2025 20:24] hardwall
My understanding though is that chiplet designs will be by their nature inferior to the same design but integrated on the same die. But more composable and faster turnaround. ( again, i'm not sure I even understand properly what I'm talking about)

Wow, threw Claude a request to do some research, You weren't kidding, the world is littered with the bodies of chiplet interconnect initiatives.


[10/25/2025 00:00] anfroholic
If this were ever to be a thing, I think the first step would be an open source [SerDes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SerDes) for ASIC design. 
I was speaking with @carlfk the other day about putting HDMI on an ASIC design and he said this part was still a current hurdle.
Chiplets--at least the current versions from AMD--all communicate over SerDes.

A Serializer/Deserializer (SerDes) is a pair of functional blocks commonly used in high speed communications to compensate for limited input/output. These blocks convert data between serial data and parallel interfaces in each direction. The term "SerDes" generically refers to interfaces used in various technologies and applications. The primary...


[10/25/2025 01:32] mithro_
The problem turns out to be economics -- at the moment chiplets makes sense when things are very expensive -- but to get an ROI you need to sell a lot of units, thus if you are selling lots of units you want the chiplets to be customized for your use case.....


[10/25/2025 06:01] anfroholic
I was under the impression that some of the economics came from just yield gains?
I also personally think some of the coolest stuff (other than wafer.space) happening right now is in the packaging space. 

@HardWall I do see a potential case *maybe* where the design for the opposing interconnect would be designed by the one party. And the second party can put that into their design. 
Also something else, is if you start to think of things like PCBs where you have a series of components on a PCB, a similar concept would be a series of dies on a silicon interposer.

@Andrew Wingate - Below 5nm, chiplets ***do*** make sense for making these high end chips (for yield and other cost reasons). 

The problem is the chiplet marketplace / reuse idea. 

Basically, the people working on these high end nodes need to make a large number of parts to recoup the cost of the design. When you go, "I'm going to need to make 1 million of these parts" then it pretty much always makes sense to customize the chiplet for that part.
