This is a blurb about their work:

Will Salcedo (https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-salcedo/) and Vamshi Balangala (https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamshibalanaga/) are building enhanced EDA tools on top of OpenLane that improve the speed, scalability, and quality of existing open-source tools. We are using GPU-accelerated approaches and AI to get at least 100x runtime improvements over legacy tools. If you are struggling with closing out designs, we would love to help you get to tapeout faster.

Will and Vamshi are hoping to find people interested in what they're doing, and possibly willing to experiment with what they've done so far, so if anyone would be prepared to at least reach out to them and find out more, please let me know. From what Will was telling me, their approach was to greatly accelerate parts of the resizing/repair, with the intent initially of doing far greater design-space exploration (since for larger designs or extreme timing/density requirements, this can often be a bottleneck). They have also contemplated adapting their work to things like IR drop analysis.

It sounds interesting (and a few of us at Efabless started talking to them late 2024 and it was already showing promise then), and I'm just sharing this around as a favour.","",""

I also personally think some of the coolest stuff (other than wafer.space) happening right now is in the packaging space. 

@HardWall I do see a potential case *maybe* where the design for the opposing interconnect would be designed by the one party. And the second party can put that into their design. 
Also something else, is if you start to think of things like PCBs where you have a series of components on a PCB, a similar concept would be a series of dies on a silicon interposer.","",""

The problem is the chiplet marketplace / reuse idea. 

Basically, the people working on these high end nodes need to make a large number of parts to recoup the cost of the design. When you go, ""I'm going to need to make 1 million of these parts"" then it pretty much always makes sense to customize the chiplet for that part.","","💜 (1)"
