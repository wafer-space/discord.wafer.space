This looks amazing Bunnie, can't wait to see more!

This also led me to listen to a 14yr old [the-amp-hour-84-bunnies-bibelot-bonification](https://theamphour.com/the-amp-hour-84-bunnies-bibelot-bonification/) podcast where he made a prediction about the future. 
He predicted there would not be much architectural improvements, because moore's law was moving so fast, but eventually when that slowed down we would start to see some novel and new approaches. 

Seems it's coming true in the best way!! @bunnie did you think you'd be the hero you were looking for? 😉 
Anyways, great stuff! Thank you for everything you're doing!","","❤️ (1)"

It's great to see","",""
