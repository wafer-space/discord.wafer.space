Just watched another [great presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaWkfSmIgRs) from @bunnie about his new chip/architectures. 
This looks amazing Bunnie, can't wait to see more!

This also led me to listen to a 14yr old [the-amp-hour-84-bunnies-bibelot-bonification](https://theamphour.com/the-amp-hour-84-bunnies-bibelot-bonification/) podcast where he made a prediction about the future. 
He predicted there would not be much architectural improvements, because moore's law was moving so fast, but eventually when that slowed down we would start to see some novel and new approaches. 

Seems it's coming true in the best way!! @bunnie did you think you'd be the hero you were looking for? 😉 
Anyways, great stuff! Thank you for everything you're doing!

39C3 - Xous: A Pure-Rust Rethink of the Embedded Operating System
Xous is a message-passing microkernel implemented in pure Rust, targeting secure embedded applications. This talk covers three novel aspects of the OS: hardware MMU support (and why we had to make our own chip to get this feature), how and why we implemented the Rust standard library in Rust (instead of calling the C standard library, like most ...

Hah! well I've been champing at the bit for years to do something interesting with chips again...but my hope is that all the good people here will soon be putting out cool stuff I couldn't have thought up in my wildest dreams.

For sure! I think you've definitely set a bar though. 
It's great to see
