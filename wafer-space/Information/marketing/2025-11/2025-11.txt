It has never been easier to design your own integrated circuit. What’s missing is an affordable, straightforward path to real silicon that yields enough parts to build real products. For US$7,000, wafer.space delivers 1,000 raw dies so you can prototype, test, and ship.

One correction: GF180MCU (all caps) is the process, and gf180mcu is the open PDK

In the table maybe mention that Tiny Tapeout also offers other processes such as IHP SG13CMOS and SKY130?

How do you distribute full wafers if they contain proprietary designs? Or is that not a problem, since in the real world you could also simply decap a chip and reverse engineer it?

Otherwise, looks good! And ~1,000 bare dies are a nice unique selling point.


[09/06/2025 08:38] mole99
And one more thing: you mention top metal as if it were a separate layer, but in reality it is just a synonym for Metal5.


[09/06/2025 08:38] urish
IIRC it's also possible to mask out other designs from the water

Basically, when people submit their designs they give me a license which allows me to share the wafers.

Undiced Full Wafer $2k - how may of your design do you get?


[10/13/2025 08:08] 246tnt
35-ish probably. It depends a bit where you end up on the reticle.


[10/13/2025 10:48] algofoogle
Does the offer of a full undiced wafer drive away commercial customers who don’t want someone else getting hands on their bare dice, or is everything on wafer.space submissions initially expected to be open source?


[10/13/2025 12:48] urish
Not sure if it's applicable in this case, but it's possible to mask out some designs from a water by making an extra mask that blocks out specific parts of the reticle


[10/13/2025 17:00] anfroholic
I brought up that issue as well. I doubt anyone would actually use this vector to obtain anyone else's designs or IP, but at the end of the day it's kinda selling someone else's stuff. 
@urish there's also the possibility of just destroying the ones that are not yours after the fact. Drill a hole, use a laser to just ruin it a little.


[10/15/2025 01:09] mithro_
I'm happy to sacrifice those customers to offer the full wafers.

Alright, I'll try to find an open one that's close to what your artist picked. 
Or if you would just ask them, that would be great!

Maybe look at the logo source files?

Where are those?


[10/23/2025 05:50] urish
"Custom silicon. Manufactured."

This does not give customers a good reason to go with wafer.space over any other fab option. They all do "custom silicon" and manufacture it.


[10/23/2025 05:50] anfroholic
Good call, Kinda just chucked something I saw from the website,

[10/23/2025 05:52] urish
It's a question for Tim. What makes wafer.space different? 

IMHO no NDA is a big deal. 
Open source PDK is another one. 
Cost and number of parts you get is a third.

## MOSbius

![](../images/features_update/mosbius_flow.png)

**MOSbius**, developed by **Professor Peter Kinget** and his students at **Columbia University**, is an innovative educational platform that helps students and designers explore **MOS circuit topologies** typically found on silicon and now accessible on a breadboard.

The goal of MOSbius is to give learners hands-on experience with **transistor-level design**, including circuit debugging, measurement, and the full “chip bring-up” process. The platform allows users to compare calculations, simulations, and real measurements using provided **LTspice models**, bridging the gap between theory and silicon.

[![](../images/features_update/mosbius_interview.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abu3u6UX6wE)
*MOSbius – A Field Programmable Transistor Array for Chip Designers*
*Interview with Peter Kinget*

Their current board design requires numerous passive components due to varying pin voltage levels, and each packaged chip can cost upwards of **$50**. With their new design on the **Wafer.Space** platform, all pins will be **3.3 V tolerant**, dramatically simplifying their demo board and lowering overall complexity.

By leveraging **Wafer.Space’s low-cost fabrication process**, the MOSbius team is able to minimize production expenses and make their chips available to the **educational community at a nominal cost** — expanding access to hands-on silicon learning for students and researchers worldwide.

We’re thrilled to have MOSbius as part of this shuttle run and proud to support a project that aligns so perfectly with Wafer.Space’s mission!

Learn more about the project at [**mosbius.org**](https://mosbius.org/0_front_matter/intro.html).

### Their Own COB Format

Given the unique requirements of the MOSbius project, the team is designing their own version of a **Chip-on-Board (COB)** package based on the Wafer.Space standard padframe.

Their application prioritizes **a high number of I/O connections** over power and ground pads, allowing for the maximum number of accessible signals from their transistor array.

**Peter’s student, @xianglin_pui**, has taken the lead on this effort and developed derivative designs that extend the Wafer.Space COB standard for MOSbius’s specialized needs.

@peterkinget I would  like to post this in one of the upcomming updates. Would you like to add anything or make any changes?
Thanks!


[11/02/2025 12:59] peterkinget
Nice write up. Let me think a bit about it. First thought is that we still have to manage to get the order through the p/o process. Design wise we are starting to make decent progress on the chip side. Let’s circle back Friday.
