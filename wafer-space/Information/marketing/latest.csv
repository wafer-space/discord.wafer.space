![](../images/features_update/mosbius_flow.png)

**MOSbius**, developed by **Professor Peter Kinget** and his students at **Columbia University**, is an innovative educational platform that helps students and designers explore **MOS circuit topologies** typically found on silicon and now accessible on a breadboard.

The goal of MOSbius is to give learners hands-on experience with **transistor-level design**, including circuit debugging, measurement, and the full “chip bring-up” process. The platform allows users to compare calculations, simulations, and real measurements using provided **LTspice models**, bridging the gap between theory and silicon.

*MOSbius – A Field Programmable Transistor Array for Chip Designers*
*Interview with Peter Kinget*

Their current board design requires numerous passive components due to varying pin voltage levels, and each packaged chip can cost upwards of **$50**. With their new design on the **Wafer.Space** platform, all pins will be **3.3 V tolerant**, dramatically simplifying their demo board and lowering overall complexity.

By leveraging **Wafer.Space’s low-cost fabrication process**, the MOSbius team is able to minimize production expenses and make their chips available to the **educational community at a nominal cost** — expanding access to hands-on silicon learning for students and researchers worldwide.

We’re thrilled to have MOSbius as part of this shuttle run and proud to support a project that aligns so perfectly with Wafer.Space’s mission!

Learn more about the project at [**mosbius.org**](https://mosbius.org/0_front_matter/intro.html).","",""

Given the unique requirements of the MOSbius project, the team is designing their own version of a **Chip-on-Board (COB)** package based on the Wafer.Space standard padframe.

Their application prioritizes **a high number of I/O connections** over power and ground pads, allowing for the maximum number of accessible signals from their transistor array.

**Peter’s student, @xianglin_pui**, has taken the lead on this effort and developed derivative designs that extend the Wafer.Space COB standard for MOSbius’s specialized needs.","",""
