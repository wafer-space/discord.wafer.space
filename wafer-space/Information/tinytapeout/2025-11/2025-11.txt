@urish - Awesome work.


[09/17/2025 14:13] algofoogle
Great stuff  @urish 🙂 For fun I ran it on one of my old designs, and it worked: https://github.com/algofoogle/tt-gf180-toy/actions/runs/17800061560 -- I was surprised that the flow seems to define `USE_POWER_PINS` (and since my code was originally written to support Caravel, it's sensitive to those defines and gives a linter warning, though safe to ignore I guess).


[09/17/2025 14:14] algofoogle
I was thinking about using Magic's `plot` to render GDS instead of the existing renderer used by the TT actions. Maybe it will look better for IHP and GF's standard cells -- I will give it a try soon.

The verilog project template is ready!

https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttgf-verilog-template/

One caveat: the "precheck" part will fail, and that's expected. We'll fix it over the next week or two.

@urish - Should I promote that to people yet?


[09/30/2025 04:28] urish
Everyone should be able to use the template as-is right now, but we're thinking to only open submission for people who submitted to a Tiny Tapeout shuttle in the past (our past experience shows that this is a good way to get higher quality submissions)

@urish - BTW Have you ever tested what happens if someone shorts VDD to GND together aggressively?


[09/30/2025 05:07] mithro_
@urish - The power gating should stop it from causing any problem.


[09/30/2025 05:11] urish
Yes, it should stop it.


[09/30/2025 05:12] urish
But the current shuttle won't be power gated


[09/30/2025 05:25] h_thoreson_71412
I did one past TT, kinda have been digging around Discord looking for ideas to work on for the next run. Is there anything I can try to do with this that would be helpful?


[09/30/2025 05:37] urish
Started a thread.


[09/30/2025 06:21] 246tnt
@Tim 'mithro' Ansell The power gate stops it as long as you don't enable that particular design 😅   If you do enable it, you will get potentially damaging high currents.


[09/30/2025 06:22] mithro_
But have you actually tested such a thing?


[09/30/2025 06:22] 246tnt
No.


[09/30/2025 06:23] 246tnt
We had one design that had a short but it was through `li` in sky130 so it ended up drawing way more than expected and more than we recommend, but it was only ~ 15 mA which is still very much in the "chip will survive" zone.


[09/30/2025 06:25] 246tnt
I had a power gate test design that was meant to test high current usage in TT07 but I made a mistake in the layout so it wasn't able to generate very high current. There is a fixed version in TT08 but given I just got the chips yesterday, I'll wait a bit before trying to burn those 😅


[09/30/2025 06:29] urish
We do have a way to mark dangerous projects post silicon, so users get warned before enabling them through the commander app


[09/30/2025 07:20] algofoogle
Will you be taking custom GDS on this run, or just digital LibreLane generated stuff?


[09/30/2025 07:47] 246tnt
Only LibreLane stuff. Without power gating it's a bit risky to accept random GDS 😅


[09/30/2025 07:55] urish
If you manually add a power gate yourself we can consider including it


[09/30/2025 07:55] urish
Or if might just wait for the next shuttle


[09/30/2025 09:30] algofoogle
Yeah makes sense, I figured that would be the case. I think I will try an assortment of digital and analog/mixed stuff in GF180 and see whichever shuttles I can get onto, whenever 🙂


[09/30/2025 17:31] mithro_
BTW It's GF180MCU not GF180 🙂 -- Going to keep saying that because if successful we'll end up with multiple GF180 technologies.

Is there a way to reference / link / connect the https://discord.com/channels/1009193568256135208/1422290927816540402 channel from here?


[11/04/2025 05:21] urish
A link (as you posted) is the way I know


[11/04/2025 05:21] urish
You can pin the message to make it easier for others to find


[11/04/2025 07:32] xobs
This is what people see when they can’t access that channel. I think a bot is the way to go, and people I know tend to use Fletcher to teleport messages between channels and servers. I haven’t managed that particular bot myself before, though.

If you have previously submitted to any Tiny Tapeout shuttle (including TTSKY25b) and want to add your own project to this test shuttle:

1. Use this template: <https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttgf-verilog-template>
2. Submit through this link: <https://app.tinytapeout.com/projects/create?shuttle=ttgf0p2>

This is a test shuttle, so there's a chance the silicon won't work, and it's likely that we won't ship the silicon to everyone who submitted a design.


[11/07/2025 05:30] anfroholic
Are you sure the submission link is correct?


[11/07/2025 05:35] urish
Yes, once the current shuttle (SKY 25B) is over, this banner will be replaced with the deadline for the GF0p2 shuttle


[11/07/2025 05:35] anfroholic
Ah, ok. I get it, but it is confusing.

@urish - Could we get your Tiny Tapeout bot to post here for the GF shuttle too?

Good idea, will look into this


[11/14/2025 04:55] urish
Do you want it to go to this channel? Since it sometimes gets really spammy.

We can also have a dedicated channel like in the TT discord
