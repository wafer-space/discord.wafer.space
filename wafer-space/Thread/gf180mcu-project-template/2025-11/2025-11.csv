"323371864074485771","mole99","2025-10-27T07:30:50.6900000+00:00","The mapping happens in the config.yaml through the `PAD_SOUTH`, `PAD_EAST`, `PAD_NORTH` and `PAD_WEST` variables. However, [chip_top.sv](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template/blob/main/src/chip_top.sv) also needs to be changed to instantiate more or fewer pads.

You could do a 50pin mezzanine using the same 74pad padring. Simply ignore the pads that shouldn't be used. If you adjust the padring, we need to pay a second bonding setup fee. And, as you mentioned, we need more files in the template, which could confuse people.

A new bonding setup would probably only make sense if we have a new die size.","",""
