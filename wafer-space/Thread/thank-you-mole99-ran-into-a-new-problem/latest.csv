In `config.yaml`, you need to unset `CLOCK_PORT` and `CLOCK_NET`. However, there may still be some issues, so please share your repository.

If your design does not contain any digital logic at all, then you can disable all STA steps. Simply add `OpenROAD.STA*: null` to `substituting_steps` in the config.","",""
