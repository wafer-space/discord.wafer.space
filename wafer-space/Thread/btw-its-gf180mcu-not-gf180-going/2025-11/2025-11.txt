Do tell more - since in the docs/tooling, we use gf180mcuD when referring to the PDK


[09/30/2025 17:32] urish
But when talking in general about the process, we usually shorten to GF180


[09/30/2025 17:32] mithro_
Yeah, don't shorten to GF180, fine to shorten gf180mcuD to GF180MCU though.


[09/30/2025 17:36] urish
GF180MCU is annoying to type 🙂


[09/30/2025 17:36] urish
We will also need to rethink our shuttle naming convention at some point


[09/30/2025 17:36] urish
ttgf26[abcdef...]   won't easily scale to multiple processes


[09/30/2025 18:13] mole99
To clear things up: GF180MCU is the process. gf180mcu is the PDK family and gf180mcuA/B/C/D are the PDK variants.


[09/30/2025 18:14] mole99
Same for SKY130, sky130 and sky130A/B.


[09/30/2025 18:15] mole99
IHP is a bit different though 😅 
There it's: SG13G2 (or SG13CMOS), ihp-sg13g2 and ihp-sg13g2 (family and variant are the same).

GF180IC and GF180BCDLite would be potential future GF 180nm techs


[09/30/2025 19:40] mithro_
IC == Industry Compatible


[09/30/2025 19:46] urish
And I was sure it stands for "Intelligent Creatures"


[09/30/2025 19:46] urish
or at least "Intel's Competitor"


[09/30/2025 23:31] algofoogle
Ahh I see…


[09/30/2025 23:31] algofoogle
I just thought it was really cold 😉 🥶

My understanding is that GF180IC allows designs which were targeted at "other foundries standard 180nm process nodes (like say TSMC's 180nm node)" to be manufactured with no changes (except changing GDS layer ids). It may have been used when things like second sourcing where required.


[10/01/2025 00:21] mithro_
BCDLite is a cost optimized version of GF's BCD process technology. BCD (bipolar-CMOS-DMOS) technology allows to drive discrete high voltage components (several hundred of operating voltage) at high frequency while keeping high integration with advanced CMOS technology nodes.


[10/01/2025 00:21] algofoogle
Well no joke, that sounds pretty cool to me. Bill Mensch could be interested in something like that especially since his 6502 IP is “custom layout” but retargetable, as I understand


[10/01/2025 00:22] mithro_
But this is all hearsay and gossip, not necessarily the actual truth 🙂
