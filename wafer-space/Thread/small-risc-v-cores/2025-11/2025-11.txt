We've realised that the biggest constraint is really the size of the pads.  You're going to want a QSPI interface to some RAM and flash, so that's 7 or preferably 12 IOs.  And then 4 or 8 IOs for actually doing something.  By the time you've made that pad ring you might as well put at least enough RAM in it for registers.

But yes, I believe SERV can be configured to store registers in external RAM, that will be extremely slow though!

I think going for RV32E (only 15 registers) makes sense.  Also if you support the compressed instructions (which is good to save flash bandwidth if you have no/minimal icache) they mostly can only use registers that are in RV32E anyway.

I put together a spreadsheet for possible pad setups on a subdivided chip.  I don't know if the "pad strip" idea (pads on one side only) works in practice. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qEPO6t-Uz7HYwtpl9eECe0vx1UJSmiynZBl_LVMHF0k/edit?gid=0#gid=0

I believe smaller pads are theoretically possible if you're willing to reduce output drive strength and reduce the effectiveness of the ESD protection.


[09/21/2025 19:35] 246tnt
Technically nothing forces you to make a ring ... you could have a "strip"of pads on one side only.


[09/21/2025 19:35] 246tnt
(I mean from a functional stand point, that might not be directly supported in the tooling)

There is also this thing called "circuit under pads"


[09/21/2025 19:39] 246tnt
Is that allowed here ? And compatible with the bonding method ?  I know in both ihp and sky, placing anything active under the pad is a not an option.  And on sky in early mpw some people had high failure rate when bonding because there was some stuff under the pad that was getting crushed.

> Active circuits are allowed when ball-type wire-bonding process is used and when bumping/flip chip technology is used. No circuit under pad is allowed when wedge-type wire-bonding process is used. The following additional rules apply to designs when active circuits are used under the pad.

15 pins == 4 for spi bus, 3 for power, 8 for I/O?


[09/21/2025 19:56] mithro_
BTW I expect it'll take us a while to figure out what options make sense


[09/21/2025 20:01] rebelmike
I was thinking the 15 would be 7 for QSPI, 2 for power, clock, reset, 4 for IO.  But actually I think you could get 16 in that width and have an extra ground.


[09/21/2025 21:11] mithro_
I tend to think of 10 I/O as a good number as it ends up with a byte and 2 "control/signal lines"


[09/21/2025 21:56] rebelmike
Yeah, only 4 GPIOs is a bit sad.  Going to pins on 2 sides and 3x3 division might be a better option.  Or 5x2 with a single strip but the other way.
