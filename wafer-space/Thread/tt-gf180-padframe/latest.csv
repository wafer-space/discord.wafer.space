The labels (input / bidir / clk / rst) don't but that doesn't matter, all those should be broken out 1:1 without any special consideration.

It's important for the breakout that :
- The PWR VDD AUX are _not_ connected to power rings, but just broken out to pins like other , just with decoupling caps
- The IO / Core VDD pins are correctly mapped to independent rings with appropriate decoupling.","",""
