Hi, is there a release checklist for the things to take into account before doing a submission? From what I see, I need to:
1) Pass the  gf180mcu-precheck
2) Make sure the QR code is correct (what info should it contain?)
3) Are there naming conventions to follow?
4) Are there special ways in which we should save the output file?
5) Are there non DRC check we would need to run (e.g: zero size polygons)?

For the IHP tapeout, there was an issue with different guidelines, maybe something similar could be made?
I'm asking because I will do an analog tapeout and thus will not use the librelane flow. I will also have to modify the padring dimension and bond the chips myself.

Hi @Clyde Laforge!
All of these checks should be handled by the precheck. The precheck runs both the magic and KLayout DRC setup, offgrid and angle checks, density checks etc. We might need to add a zero size polygon check.

You only need to include the QR-Code cell in your design. During the precheck, its content will be replaced with the correct ID for your design.

Currently, there is no check on the file and top-level cell naming, but we might require both to be named the same. I will also add a check for the die size, since for the first run all designs will be the same size.

But other than that you are free to do what you want. You can create the GDS with LibreLane or any other software. Just make sure to pass the precheck.

If anything is not caught by the precheck and flagged by the foundry, we will make sure to improve the precheck.
Likewise, if you manage to break the precheck, please let us know so we can improve it :)
