What are you working on? LVDS/CML is something that is very interesting to me 🙂 - I would to get us to PCIe eventually.


[02/10/2026 06:34] embeddedken
An FPGA with 5V core and 1.8V-3.3V I/O; maybe a test gigabit transceiver for proving out SGMII or PCIe x1 Gen1 physical-layer capability.
I think 2.5 Gbps may be almost within the realm of reach for half-rate architecture; solid PLL and CDR would be the limiting factors.

The associated PIPE interface and Hard IP would be quite a technical challenge; possible greater than PMA development


[02/10/2026 06:35] mithro_
Also have you seen @Leo Moser (mole99)'s FPGA?


[02/10/2026 06:35] mithro_
@EmbeddedKen - If you get me the SERDES, I can get you the PIPE and reset of the stack

I do have a PCIe serial logic analyzer for decoding DLLPs and TLPs; which could help with silicon bring-up and have extensive experience debugging PCIe for FPGAs.


[02/10/2026 06:37] embeddedken
I'll see what I can do- I'm not an analog wizard; I think PLL/CDR will be the most challenging


[02/10/2026 06:37] mithro_
@EmbeddedKen - @enite and the openfasoc project where working on high quality PLL and CDR structures for SERDES in the past, I have no idea were they ended up getting too. There is some very out of date stuff in https://bit.ly/goog-analog

Their general approach was to write generators so they could eventually tape out like 50 variants to find the best solution.


[02/10/2026 06:38] mithro_
@EmbeddedKen - If we could do the slowest USB3 speed, that would be pretty epic.


[02/10/2026 06:39] embeddedken
One of the first PCIe Gen1 devices was on 180nm- which provides some additional hope. 2.5Gbps is definitely pushing the limits of the process node.

I thought SuperSpeed started at 5Gbps... that is probably well out of reach.


[02/10/2026 06:41] embeddedken
Awesome info- I'll dive into these


[02/10/2026 06:41] embeddedken
Amazing to think there's others out there working on PIPE 👏


[02/10/2026 06:56] mithro_
@EmbeddedKen - But yeah, high performance IO would be a great step, even if initially it starts at like 250MHz and then we slowly improve until we can get the 1.5GHz (or is it just 1 GHz, I've forgotten?) needed.


[02/10/2026 07:02] embeddedken
480Mbps for USB2 HS (UTMI)
1.25Gbps for 1000BASE-X/SGMII (GMII)
2.5Gbps for PCIe Gen1 (PIPE)
5.0Gbps for PCIe Gen2 / USB3 SS (PIPE)

Cool! Which tools are you targeting for synthesis and PnR? FABulous uses Yosys and nextpnr.
