I'm working on an I/O pad library for 1.8V - 3.6V LVCMOS with adjustable slew and LVDS/CML options.
For LVCMOS 3.3V, seeing half-nanosecond edges with 15pF of load; good for >500Mhz using GF's 3.3V FETs.

Any padrings so far that supported 3.3V I/O?

as I understand it, the default padring works fine with 3.3V I/O as long as you're also doing 3.3V Vcore
