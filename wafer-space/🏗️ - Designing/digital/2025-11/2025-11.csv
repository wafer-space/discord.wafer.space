Generally pick one pair of orientations (N/S only or W/E only) so that fly-by routing over the top of the RAMs on M4/M5 does a better job of hooking up the address bus. It can be useful to alternate N-S-N-S because iirc the D connections are all on one side of the RAM, and the Q are all on the other side","",""
