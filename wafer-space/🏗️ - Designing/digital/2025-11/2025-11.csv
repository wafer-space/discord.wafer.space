The fix is to use onchip SRAM block connected directly to Z80 instead of external DRAM (which usually were multiple of ICs with high chance of failure during the long lifetime). External DRAM ICs are simply pulled from the mainboard of the computer.

Adding 64KB would be better and more generic, but I can't fit them right now.","",""
