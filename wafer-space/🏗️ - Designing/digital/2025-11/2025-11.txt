Huh ... so as part of testing I wanted to remove the `DualGate` layer from the standar cells to make the transistors 3v3 instead of 5V. Yes, they're gate would be longer than needed because I'm not resizing them, just changing the oxide thickness, hoping for them to get faster basically.

But ... simulation shows they get _slower_ ....


[11/27/2025 12:46] 246tnt
First theory is of course, thinner oxide means more gate capacitance and whatever gain we have from the thinner oxide forming better channel gets overwhelmed by the higher gate capacitance.

I could also have screwed up my simulation somewhere ...

I'd say its because the gate lengths are still the same


[11/27/2025 12:55] 246tnt
Well yeah, I know it's because their length is the same, but through what effect.


[11/27/2025 12:56] 246tnt
At 3.3V Vg and Vds, Ids is higher for 3v3 one (as expected) so it's better at passing current. (same W/L)

Although looking at the curve, it's really not _that_ much better.

@tnt For a given gate size, wouldn't lower voltages mean slower circuits?


[11/27/2025 13:06] 246tnt
@bailey I'm changing the transistor type, but both get powered using 3v3 .

Of course if I'm powering the 5V with 5V they go faster 😁
