That must be the longest power point for a presentation I have seen in my life. :)))

Tim is great like this. At his SuperCon talk he said there were 115 slides in his 26min talk. 
Keep it up Tim!!

Timothy Ansell - Xilinx Series 7 FPGAs Now Have a Fully Open Source...
You should be super excited about FPGAs and how they allow open source projects to do hardware development. In this talk I will cover a basic introduction into what an FPGA is and can do, what an FPGA toolchain is, and how much things sucked when the only option was to use proprietary toolchains. The SymbiFlow project changed this and I’ll dis...

For some reason, I can’t  run cocotb anymore? Even in projects where it used to work, on two different systems and inside the iic-osic-tools container. Its all broken.
It instantly quits with the message `/bin/sh: line 1: /cmds.f: Permission denied` when trying to build target `/sim.vpp`


[10/30/2025 20:45] tholin
Yeah, apparently there was an update and I had to edit all my makefiles.


[10/30/2025 20:45] tholin
I get console spam before my tests run, though

@Tholin You can use the Nix setup in the template which comes with cocotb 2.0.

Yes, that is to be expected given that iverilog does not support that feature. This is only important, however, if you run SDF-backannotated simulations.


[11/01/2025 04:30] tholin
So, about the fab SRAM macros: they have their VDD/VSS power straps on the Metal3 layer in the form of horizontal strips. However, the vertical Metal4 strips in chip_top’s power grid will not connect to them. Why?

[11/01/2025 04:44] tholin
Also, the SRAM macros have DRC errors.


[11/01/2025 06:15] 246tnt
Are you sure they do ?  AFAIR Magic thinks they do because the tech file doesn't know about sram rules. But if you checks they are all false positive


[11/01/2025 08:39] rebelmike
I believe the SRAM macro in https://github.com/MichaelBell/ttgf0p2-tinyQV/actions/runs/18697252507 is connected correctly, though would appreciate a double check on that!

However, that project is a bit stalled, both because of the DRC errors (which should be ignorable), and because when I increased the utilisation I started getting LVS errors.


[11/01/2025 09:29] 246tnt
It's connected through power but only on the end. The only reason I can think of for that is that the LEF only defines the end zone as pins for connections.

[11/01/2025 09:31] 246tnt
It's also connected in the center control zone. So maybe they wanted to avoid random vias in the SRAM core zone, maybe it can distord metal a bit or cause some stress that they didn't want to risk given the tighter rules they use in there.


[11/01/2025 10:27] rebelmike
Yeah, I had to be fairly precise aligning the met4 stripes to get the connections to align with the pins.


[11/02/2025 14:45] tholin
Any reason why only those end zones are valid pins? Could the LEF be updated to label the whole horizontal strips?


[11/02/2025 16:50] 246tnt
As stated above, the only reason I can think of is avoid any disturbance in the sram core area ...


[11/14/2025 21:45] rebelmike
I'm trying to do a quick port of TinyQV to the wafer space template.  I've hit the problem that a lot of the verilog has declaration after use, which isn't supported by iverilog 13.  Is there an easy way to get iverilog 12 in the nix environment to get the tests passing?  I tried simply commenting out the iverilog line in the nix.flake (in the hope of picking up the version from the system) but that didn't seem to help (or possibly I need to do something to pick up the change - I am new to nix)

@mole99 ^

The template uses iverilog from nix-eda: https://github.com/fossi-foundation/nix-eda/blob/main/nix/iverilog.nix
We can simply override the version and hash using an overlay:

+                };
+              };
+            })
+          ];
         }
     );
```

(I also had to add a cflag in order for it to compile.)
The first time you enable the Nix shell, iverilog will be built, after that, it is cached.


[11/15/2025 11:12] rebelmike
Thank you! I’ll give that a try

@mole99 AFAICT for the PAD_xxx config you need exact names you can't use regexps 😢


[11/15/2025 17:03] mole99
You mean in the LibreLane pad ring config? Yeah, that would be a nice feature. I'll see if I can add it in https://github.com/librelane/librelane/pull/806. I'm quite busy at the moment, though 😅


[11/15/2025 22:20] polyfractal
the SRAM verilog macros in the PDK are fully functional, right? Debugging an issue in my code and want to verify that they do, infact, work as intended 🙂  

(I've successfully stored and retrieved, but when writing to same address twice there are problems. Fairly sure it's my fault elsewhere though)


[11/16/2025 03:02] mithro_
Yes, I believe @Tholin has demonstrated them working?
