generated a few latch and dff banks using dffram, neat project! latches were consistently 10-15% smaller than dff, and as expected they are all quite a bit bigger than the foundry optimized banks. Not really a fair comparison, will probably run some tests comparing it against a dumb register array since that's a lot closer to the use case
