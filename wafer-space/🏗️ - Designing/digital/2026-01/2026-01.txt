@BreakingTaps - That is super cool! Can you publish that somewhere publically?

@BreakingTaps - I would expect the latch version to be more like 30-40% smaller than the DFF version but maybe they need optmized layouts or something?

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell In latch vs DFF only the storage element is smaller. All the address decoding and enable and muxing logic is the same and it's not small either.

True. That this is why data is better than random speculation from me 🙂
