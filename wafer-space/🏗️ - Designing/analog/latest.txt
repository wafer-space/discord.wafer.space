Awesome Clyde 🥳
I'll start upstreaming the wafer.space changes to the FOSSi repos soon. However, you don't necessarily have to wait for that, since your LVS changes should be standalone?

It is slightly dependent, as it adds new GUI options, but let's discuss it when I open the MR, maybe they are not necessary
