      "content": "Been dabbling with analog recently and was curiosu if any of the automated analog layout tools worked well. ALIGN (https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public) looked most promising and had a Sky130 PDK, so I threw Claude Code at it. Sorta have a working GF180 PDK now? Takes in a spice netlist, constraints (matching, symmetry, etc) and spits out GDS\n\nFound some pretty serious limitations though, namely that ALIGN was built with finfet nodes in mind so there are a lot of restrictive routing/placement constraints baked into the core. Had to modify the core to get even moderately compact layouts and it's still a lot of wasted space. DRC and LVS match, but haven't run simulations on the generated output yet... could be hot garbage \ud83d\ude05 \n\nStill, neato tool. Kinda want to start working on something that's tailored for big legacy nodes that have less restrictive DRC.\n\n(screenshot is a CSA + Discriminator + Krummenacher feedback circuit that i've been playing around with)",
