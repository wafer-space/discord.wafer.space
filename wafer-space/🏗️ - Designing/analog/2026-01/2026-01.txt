Finally got the LVS working end-to-end from xschem to klayout without any manual  conversion steps from a user point of view 🎉 
Just need to wait for @Leo Moser (mole99)  to upstream the improvements from wafer space now 🙂

And did you check you didn't break the xschem / magic / netgen flow ? (like if you changed anything in the xschem symbols for instance that could break the other flows ... )

The changes are fully contained in the klayout directory, so likelihood of breaking other flows is rather low
