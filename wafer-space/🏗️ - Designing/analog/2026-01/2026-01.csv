ALIGN (https://github.com/ALIGN-analoglayout/ALIGN-public) looked most promising and had a Sky130 PDK, so I threw Claude Code at it. Sorta have a working GF180 PDK now? Takes in a spice netlist, constraints (matching, symmetry, etc) and spits out GDS

Found some pretty serious limitations though, namely that ALIGN was built with finfet nodes in mind so there are a lot of restrictive routing/placement constraints baked into the core. Had to modify the core to get even moderately compact layouts and it's still a lot of wasted space. DRC and LVS match, but haven't run simulations on the generated output yet... could be hot garbage 😅 

Still, neato tool. Kinda want to start working on something that's tailored for big legacy nodes that have less restrictive DRC.
