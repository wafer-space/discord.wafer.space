Crazy how long ago all those decisions seem. From what I remember there were a number of reasons. 
First was just that the original character code was too hard to resolve with low quality optics, so something bigger was wanted. 
Second was just to have something that was easily machine readable from any orientation. 
We also wanted this to double as a macro pin1 designator.

Lol, I don't want to think about that 😜 From what I'm learning about everything, it's doubtful that would be a realistic scenario. 

That said; if there was a giant pile, it would be an interesting CS type problem with QR codes and everything @Tholin was just mentioning.

then you have to make another machine that can load the dies and identify them through a microscope

Reminds me when I dropped a tray of mpw1 wlcsp on the floor ... and then spent like an hour finding them all ...

yeah, I dropped one of those little trays and it was very hard getting them back inside with the right orientation
