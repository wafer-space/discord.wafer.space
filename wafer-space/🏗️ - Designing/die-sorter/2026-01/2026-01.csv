"323371864074485771","mole99","2026-01-09T07:45:52.1920000+00:00","We had expected the total reticle size to be 3.2x2.6 as it was back at Efabless. This would have left a 1 mm margin on all sides of our 3.0 x 2.4 mm design. However, the margin was much smaller than this (the test structures don't occupy much area).

Thus, it is not clear whether there is some spacing between the reticle shots to match the 3.2x2.6 size, or if there is no gap between the shots. Given the density rules, I assume there will be no gap.","",""

However, we don't have access to the SLM (Scribe Line Monitor) Etest and reliability test patterns. These are normally placed inbetween the scribe lines of the designs.

So in our case, these structures will be placed around our 3.0x2.4 layout. That's why we were told that our reticle size is 3.0x2.4 instead of the 3.2x2.6 that Efabless had available. (Efabless did not assemble the reticle, but GF did it for them.)
As it turns the SLM structures don't occupy that much area, which makes sense given that they are normally placed inbetween the scribe lines. Thus the final reticle size is less than 3.2x2.6.","","👍 (1)"
