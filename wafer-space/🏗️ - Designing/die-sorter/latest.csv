To give you a sense of scale, here’s what one run looks like:  
- 50 full wafers  
- 28 reticle shots (each a “group photo” of all projects) per wafer  
- 40 unique projects per reticle shot  
- Add it up and you get **56,000 project dies**  
- Each die is about the size of a few grains of rice: 3.88 mm × 5.08 mm  
- Laid out flat, that’s over 8 ft² (0.8 m²) of silicon — basically a coffee table made of chips  

In electronics manufacturing, tape-and-reel is the standard way to package components, so that’s our target. We looked at wafer packs (think plastic ice cube trays for chips) and gel packs, but reels make the most sense at this scale.  

The wafers will arrive pre-sliced and mounted on tape frames. With so many dies to handle, we’re going straight from wafer to reel — no detours.  

I can’t wait to see all the designs people come up with, and I’ll keep posting updates as this project rolls forward (pun intended).","",""

The concept is straightforward: the wafer sits right in the center, surrounded by 40 tape-and-reel stations (20 on each side). Each station will load a specific die into its own reel and then seal it up with protective film, ready for shipping :)","/home/runner/work/discord.wafer.space/discord.wafer.space/public/assets/media/image-236E6.png,/home/runner/work/discord.wafer.space/discord.wafer.space/public/assets/media/image-3309E.png","wowtherebuddy (1)"

I started [gf180mcu-precheck](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck) a few days ago. It is a custom LibreLane flow to read the user GDS, perform various checks (e.g. top-level, density, etc.), insert the ID, and whatever else we need. At the end, you receive the final GDS used for fabrication.

I use the KLayout API to generate the shapes for the ID. Currently, I'm using the built-in TEXT PCell to generate the digits for the ID, but we can use anything else: a QR code, a pattern of dots etc.

One thing to consider: we should not specify a fixed position for the ID. Instead, we provide an abstract cell for the ID that the user can place anywhere on their die, which is later replaced with the generated ID. This allows to do custom padframes (or no padframes at all). I can extract the position of the ID cell during the precheck. With the location of the die on the reticle and the offset of the ID, you can position the camera above the ID.

As for the layers, I would place the ID at Metal5 (topmost layer) with a no-fill shape around it. I assume this will give enough contrast. There are ways to achieve different colors with diffraction patterns, however, I'm no expert on that :)","","💜 (1)"

It would be *nice* if we could embed two pieces of information (probably optionally?) -- 
 (a) The checksum of the source file and

Basically if someone is looking at the die being able to get a link to the source code for the project would be pretty rad.......

These are all great!
I have a few OSHWA certified things (I have been lazy about posting more) https://certification.oshwa.org/us002531.html

If it's a machine readable code it would be nice if it were a URL 
This URL is over 40 chars which would put it in the 22-24x range. This density also just starts to look like a dot at macro scales and would fill the pin1 specification

Data matrix are more meant for smaller things so I believe this should be the default choice. They are also read by my phone natively so that is a bonus. 

I think this puts us with wanting some kind of ISBN like @urish was saying, but this could just as easily be a serial number. 
Also having this point to a website also allows a place to put all the fabrication data, ie. process, run#, date and everything else. 
This has the added benefit I think of also having a way to point to source files--*or not depending if you want to**","/home/runner/work/discord.wafer.space/discord.wafer.space/public/assets/media/Data-Matrix-Size_Data-comparison-chart-4C4AD.png",""

Having said that, I did one see a bipolar process that used epitaxy for the base and growth rate was higher towards the centre of the wafer.
