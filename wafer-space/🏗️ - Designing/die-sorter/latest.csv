First was just that the original character code was too hard to resolve with low quality optics, so something bigger was wanted. 
Second was just to have something that was easily machine readable from any orientation. 
We also wanted this to double as a macro pin1 designator.","",""

That said; if there was a giant pile, it would be an interesting CS type problem with QR codes and everything @Tholin was just mentioning.","",""
