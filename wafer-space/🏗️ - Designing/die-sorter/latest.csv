When I design, I usually like to do things and learn about the design space. Lot's and lots of terrible things that are then used to validate small ideas and concepts. 
Breadth first search 🙂 

So this was one of the first designs and it uses 13"" reels. I have decided they are too big and have since retooled for 7"" reels. Quite a few iterations","die-sorter_media/try_4_60_3-BED6B.png,die-sorter_media/20260120_000924-CEA15.jpg","❤️ (1)"

Since that time it seems we are wanting to have 1/2 and maybe 1/4 sizes which explodes the number of reels that we need. 
Just a reticle like the one shown is already 56 unique projects. 
@Tim 'mithro' Ansell is asking about these pictures, where  I was taking these reels and attempting to see how many I could squeeze into the available footprint. 
Here we have 60reels. For a lot of reasons I don't think this is a viable route to continue, but I'll keep posting","die-sorter_media/try_4_60_1-98A9C.png,die-sorter_media/try_4_60_2-89264.png",""
