reckon it's possible for a small handful of dies to get sorted out separately? I.e. I'd love like 20 dies to have bare (microscopy, die shots, etc) and the rest sent off to the COB folks

I'm sure that is doable!
@Tim 'mithro' Ansell you agree?

I'd probably suggest cutting off a bit of the tape before it gets sent off or something like that?


[11/27/2025 00:35] anfroholic
Yeah, something like that is what i had in mind

❤️ that would be rad! fwiw, would also be happy to pay for the extra hassle. just didn't want to splash out for a whole extra wafer 🙂

funnily enough, that drastically increases my confidence of placing an order. even if the chip is completely unusable from my bad design (putting that at like 70% chance heh), i can still make a nice video about it with microscope photos 🙂

You're in the states and so am I, that makes getting a small thing to you fairly trivial for me.

@BreakingTaps - There will most certainly be a bunch of assets useful for marketing and such floating around.
