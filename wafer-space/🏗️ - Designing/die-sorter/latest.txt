Hey everyone, like Tim mentioned, we’re building a die-sorting robot!  

To give you a sense of scale, here’s what one run looks like:  
- 50 full wafers  
- 28 reticle shots (each a “group photo” of all projects) per wafer  
- 40 unique projects per reticle shot  
- Add it up and you get **56,000 project dies**  
- Each die is about the size of a few grains of rice: 3.88 mm × 5.08 mm  
- Laid out flat, that’s over 8 ft² (0.8 m²) of silicon — basically a coffee table made of chips  

In electronics manufacturing, tape-and-reel is the standard way to package components, so that’s our target. We looked at wafer packs (think plastic ice cube trays for chips) and gel packs, but reels make the most sense at this scale.  

The wafers will arrive pre-sliced and mounted on tape frames. With so many dies to handle, we’re going straight from wafer to reel — no detours.  

I can’t wait to see all the designs people come up with, and I’ll keep posting updates as this project rolls forward (pun intended).

@Andrew Wingate - 3.88 mm x 5.08mm is a lot bigger than a fingernail clipping unless your not clipping your fingernails a normal amount 😛

Yeah.. it's kinda close in sq units. it's a thumbnail at 1mm


[09/23/2025 02:21] anfroholic
These are very early models, just exploring how all the pieces might fit together into a compact machine; after all, this whole setup has to ship to Singapore!  

The concept is straightforward: the wafer sits right in the center, surrounded by 40 tape-and-reel stations (20 on each side). Each station will load a specific die into its own reel and then seal it up with protective film, ready for shipping :)

They also have tape, which seems to be around a dollar at qty 100. They never give the real prices until you start talking with them.

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell I've been playing with a few cameras and microscopes that I have. That 2mp camera I was talking about cannot read these IDs. Also the crappy usb microscope I have also does nothing to help. 
I also have a 48MP microscope and it also cannot read these id's. What I have shown here is about the best zoom I'm able to get out of it. It's possible with some better light we could get a better look, but at the end of the day these are very very small features.

[09/25/2025 09:22] 246tnt
I would have tought you'd use the position on the wafer to sort, not trying to read those tiny IDs.


[09/25/2025 09:24] urish
I guess you could also visuallly compare the pattern with a reference, if you want to go optical


[09/25/2025 09:25] anfroholic
I came up with this and wanted your opinion of if this is a viable option.
The idea is to create larger characters that can fit in every corner. The process and run could somehow be encoded if desired, but all that info is in the id anyways.

[09/25/2025 09:27] anfroholic
Tim has expressed interest in verification steps along the way. 
Additionally, there seems to be little trust that all wafers will be the exact same (even if this is just how things are mounted on the wafer frame after dicing.


[09/25/2025 09:28] urish
How many projects are you going to have on a wafer?


[09/25/2025 09:29] anfroholic
That's also a good idea, but not sure how easy it would be to establish some kind of baseline


[09/25/2025 09:29] anfroholic
40 projects per reticle shot
28 full reticle shots per wafer


[09/25/2025 09:30] anfroholic
There will be some partials at the edges and sides that will be discarded afaik


[09/25/2025 09:30] urish
So we need less than 6 bits of data. I don't think letters are the best way to attack this (but they may just be good enough)


[09/25/2025 09:32] anfroholic
Originally I had thought just naughts and crosses and 'None' could do it, then thought why stop there


[09/25/2025 09:32] anfroholic
alphabet alone is 26^4 = 456,976


[09/25/2025 09:32] urish
The other question is whether you also want to encode the run id somehow


[09/25/2025 09:33] urish
in case one wanted to identify which wafer the die belongs to


[09/25/2025 09:33] anfroholic
There is also the process and the run, yes


[09/25/2025 09:33] anfroholic
There is always still the ID


[09/25/2025 09:33] urish
but is that for the #die-sorter


[09/25/2025 09:33] anfroholic
I am not suggesting we remove that


[09/25/2025 09:33] anfroholic
Correct, basically just the die sorter


[09/25/2025 09:35] urish
so I'd just keep it as simple as possible. 

Maybe like 2x2 matrices on each edge, that gives you a total of 16 bits, so you could actually encode the data twice + parity? You can also use some of the bits for detecting the orientation


[09/25/2025 09:37] urish
Looking at the space, triangle shape (3-bits) will probably fit better


[09/25/2025 09:37] anfroholic
That's also a great idea.


[09/25/2025 09:37] urish
something like:

then you can just cut these shapes out and start playing tetris with the pieces


[09/25/2025 09:41] urish
looking at the samples you send, the padring has one darker edge - is that always the case? If yes, then you can use that for orientation


[09/25/2025 09:41] urish
(in any case orientation needs to be sorted out for packaging)


[09/25/2025 09:41] anfroholic

@mole99 - Thoughts on IDs?

[09/25/2025 17:04] 246tnt
BTW, are raw dies on reel something common ? (i.e. would packaging house usually be equipped to handle that)


[09/25/2025 17:05] 246tnt
Side note: I tried reading the die-ID on my MPW1 chip with my microscope and no way ... I can barely make-out the OSHW logo and that's if I light it at just the right angle ...

[09/25/2025 17:30] mithro_
@Andrew Wingate / @mole99 - We probably want a "pin 1" type marker as well for orientation.


[09/25/2025 19:04] digshadow
@Tim 'mithro' Ansell how quickly do you need something? maybe sync up this weekend?


[09/25/2025 19:34] mithro_
@digshadow - Well, having an ID which is readable by people beyond your friends seems like something we should do 🙂


[09/25/2025 19:34] digshadow
Hmmm? Need more context


[09/25/2025 19:35] mithro_
Dunno - but reels are the preferred format for PCBA houses normally.


[09/25/2025 19:36] 246tnt
Yeah, because of pick and place machines, but if the machine dealing with dies aren't made for those, that won't help 😅


[09/25/2025 19:37] mithro_
At the moment the IDs which where used on the Google shuttles don't seem to be easily readable by the equipment that @tnt or @Andrew Wingate have. Thus it might be good for us to go with an ID which is bigger and allows more people to read them easily without having to get a good microscope from you 🙂

{Reactions}
👍

[09/25/2025 19:39] mithro_
@tnt - Yeah, these are the type of questions we are trying to sort out now, I'd like to do at least some type of short PCBA with wire bonding run (probably using GFMPW-0 or GFMPW-1 ICs) ASAP.


[09/26/2025 02:02] anfroholic
Pardon the mess. 
This is the microscope I used to send the picture above. The crappy little black usb microscope on it's side also did not seem to work very well. Some of it could be bad lighting, user error, or they really are just too small to be read by crappy equipment.

Yes, a pin1 is probably highly useful


[09/26/2025 02:04] anfroholic
I was trying to come up with something that would still be at least partially useful if the dies were cut up further, but I think now that's another problem.


[09/26/2025 02:16] anfroholic
Expanding on @urish idea of some bitwise information encoded into the corners we could also go maybe as far as something like this
if the corners of the triangles are always black--or whatever color--that could be used to identify location/skew/etc. and if triangle has a side length of 5 that leaves 12bits of info per corner--this obviously does not count for the pin1 corner though. 
The deeper we dive into this, the more it seems like it may be useful to keep these human readable.

[09/26/2025 04:37] mithro_



[09/26/2025 07:36] 246tnt
IME contrast / color is extremely dependent on how you light the samples.


[09/26/2025 08:05] mole99
I'm on my way back from Austrochip, so I can reply to questions again :)

I started [gf180mcu-precheck](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck) a few days ago. It is a custom LibreLane flow to read the user GDS, perform various checks (e.g. top-level, density, etc.), insert the ID, and whatever else we need. At the end, you receive the final GDS used for fabrication.

I use the KLayout API to generate the shapes for the ID. Currently, I'm using the built-in TEXT PCell to generate the digits for the ID, but we can use anything else: a QR code, a pattern of dots etc.

One thing to consider: we should not specify a fixed position for the ID. Instead, we provide an abstract cell for the ID that the user can place anywhere on their die, which is later replaced with the generated ID. This allows to do custom padframes (or no padframes at all). I can extract the position of the ID cell during the precheck. With the location of the die on the reticle and the offset of the ID, you can position the camera above the ID.

As for the layers, I would place the ID at Metal5 (topmost layer) with a no-fill shape around it. I assume this will give enough contrast. There are ways to achieve different colors with diffraction patterns, however, I'm no expert on that :)

@mole99 / @Andrew Wingate - Just had a random idea which may or may not be very good. 

It would be *nice* if we could embed two pieces of information (probably optionally?) -- 
 (a) The checksum of the source file and 
 (b) a URL / Link to the GDS (maybe stored on archive.org or something?)

Basically if someone is looking at the die being able to get a link to the source code for the project would be pretty rad.......

Would probably need to be a QRCode type thing?

A Data Matrix is a two-dimensional code consisting of black and white "cells" or dots arranged in either a square or rectangular pattern, also known as a matrix. The information to be encoded can be text or numeric data. The usual data size is from a few bytes up to 1556 bytes. The length of the encoded data depends on the number of cells in the...

I was just about to mention data matrix


[10/01/2025 19:07] urish
Another way to go about this is to create some kind of open source chip registry


[10/01/2025 19:08] urish
and give each chip a unique number


[10/01/2025 19:08] mithro_
> The most popular application for Data Matrix is marking small items, due to the code's ability to encode fifty characters in a symbol that is readable at 2 or 3 mm2 (0.003 or 0.005 sq in) and the fact that the code can be read with only a 20% contrast ratio.[1] A Data Matrix is scalable; commercial applications exist with images as small as 300 micrometres (0.012 in) (laser etched on a 600-micrometre (0.024 in) silicon device)

@urish - I was thinking about the same thing. Maybe something we could look at with the https://oshwa.org/ ?

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell I got the webhook going. We can add others later if you'd like, or create a more general channel that just catches them all. \

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell @mole99 @urish 

These are all great!
I have a few OSHWA certified things (I have been lazy about posting more) https://certification.oshwa.org/us002531.html

If it's a machine readable code it would be nice if it were a URL 
This URL is over 40 chars which would put it in the 22-24x range. This density also just starts to look like a dot at macro scales and would fill the pin1 specification

Data matrix are more meant for smaller things so I believe this should be the default choice. They are also read by my phone natively so that is a bonus. 

I think this puts us with wanting some kind of ISBN like @urish was saying, but this could just as easily be a serial number. 
Also having this point to a website also allows a place to put all the fabrication data, ie. process, run#, date and everything else. 
This has the added benefit I think of also having a way to point to source files--*or not depending if you want to**

Are dies good right up to the edge ? Or is there a min distance from the wafer edge for them to be viable ?


[10/02/2025 06:12] anfroholic
This is something I actually have no knowledge in. It should be pretty easy to change when we do know. The entire thing was an artifact of creating pick maps and the sort


[10/02/2025 06:13] anfroholic
also it looks pretty :)

[10/02/2025 06:17] valgamaa
It depends on your definition of good, but a mature process should have defects evenly distributed across the wafer. If they aren’t then there is a systematic problem in the process that the foundry would work to eliminate.

[10/02/2025 06:21] 246tnt
@Valgamaa What I meant is I recently saw some wafers ( might have been at IHP can't remember if it was those one ) where there was a visually apparent borders of a few mm around the physical wafer edge were obviously some of the processing wasn't done right up to the edge and so any die in that area would obviously be scrap. But I don't know if this is standard and how it is for GF180mcu specifically.

Started a thread.

It seems to be quite normal these days that the steppers stay within the radius of the wafer with a small margin. I guess there is no point in exposing to the edge where part of the chip lies off-chip, that is a waste of time. This isn't (shouldn't be) because the processing 'quality' deteriorates towards the edge, just a practical limit for handling the wafer. Having said that, I did one see a bipolar process that used epitaxy for the base and growth rate was higher towards the centre of the wafer. This resulted in devices where each wafer had the full process spread depending on where on the wafer the die were taken from; higher ft at the edges, higher Vceo towards the centre. It was soon discontinued!

You can see the edge of a wafer in pictures on the website.

Makes me wonder - if you chop the top corner off a TT die, would it still be functional to some extent (as long as the controller, muxes, power pins, the mux control pins and a few IO pins are still there...)

Cool!! 
I clicked on all the links. Seems there is a lot of convergent design, I can't really tell the difference between any. 
Wonder how true chatgpt's numbers are.
