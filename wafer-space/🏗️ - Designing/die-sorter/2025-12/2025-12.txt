(or even the same number, larger and more expensive. I just want more SRAM 😅 )

Well, you can start by using the 3v3 SRAM 😁


[12/16/2025 17:40] polyfractal
i did forget about that! is that in a working state?

_searches backlog_

After that you could do multi-die ? You have one die of _just_ SRAM and you bond it directly to your "compute" die 😁

chiplets FTW.

"working"  is unknown, we'll see after this tapeout.

Let me just clear a few things up: The photo masks are produced for the reticle, which is 30x24mm (actually 32x26mmm, but we can't use the full area atm). We subdivide this area into 40 slots, some are full size, others are smaller.

The photo mask is exposed and moved across the wafer multiple times to cover the whole wafer. wafer.space ordered a fixed number of wafers from GF, which means we end up with a certain number of dies.
Giving you fewer dies won't increase the size of your project, we would have to throw them away as they are produced anyway.

However, we can increase the size of your project by merging two 1x1 slots. This would be possible if wafer.space uses laser dicing (which we don't use for run 1), as otherwise we would cut through your project.

So, yes, it's possible in theory, but it would be more expensive.

PS: For this special first run, we actually duplicated all paid projects so that wafer.space could order less wafers, but can still fullfil the 1000 dies per project. In this case we could have actually doubled the area for your design and you would have received the half amount of dies. However, we still don't use laser dicing ^^

gotcha, thanks! yeah the "cut through the project with a saw" was the part I was worried about, didn't think of laser dicing though. perhaps in the future after a few successful runs and wafer.space is solidly established 🙂

👌

out of curiosity, what's the order-of-magnitude cost difference for laser dicing vs saw?


[12/16/2025 17:49] polyfractal
are they just nanosecond 1064nm fiber lasers, or something fancier ("stealth dicing" with femtosecond or whatever)

@BreakingTaps - See some diagrams earlier in this channel....
