Forgot this repo was tied here

@Andrew Wingate - I /think/ the cuts will probably end up in exactly the same size despite the weird slot sizes around the corner......

There are extra 1mm wide dies that are on here that will not actually be dies, but will still be on the wafer. 
@Leo Moser (mole99) said

which leaves 1mm around all the edges of *our reticle* but the reticle shots will still be spaced on the 32000x26000 spacing. 

At least that's how I'm reading this right now. 
I know there's some cleanup to do but overall this is correct yes?

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell 
Is this a little more clear?

What are the red dots?


[12/12/2025 07:10] anfroholic
Those are my pick locations


[12/12/2025 07:11] anfroholic
The green ones will be ignored.


[12/12/2025 07:12] anfroholic
better?

I ***suspect*** the layout to look like that original reticle diagram, with our portion of the reticle aligned with the bottom left edge of the reticle. That then means that even though we only get to use a percentage of the small slots the die still end up as the same size.


[12/12/2025 07:15] anfroholic
That's an easy fix, for now I'll just assume it's centered, but the patterning will still be on the 32000x26000 spacing, correct?

@Andrew Wingate - Does carl still have the GFMPW-0 / GFMPW-1 wafers around?


[12/12/2025 07:18] anfroholic
I have this

Is that a gf180mcu or sky130 wafer?


[12/12/2025 07:19] anfroholic
I don't know, sorry
