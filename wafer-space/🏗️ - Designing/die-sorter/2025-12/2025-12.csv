This now also exports a csv with reticle data and row/col
```csv
X ,Y ,RETICLE_SHOT, COL|ROW
-94.276,-12.092,S-4_-1,C8R2
-94.276,-6.998,S-4_-1,C8R3
-94.276,-3.171,S-4_-1,C8R4
-94.276,-0.94,S-4_-1,C8R5
-94.276,2.535,S-4_0,C8R0
-94.276,7.629,S-4_0,C8R1
-94.276,12.723,S-4_0,C8R2
```

I have been going through in my mind how I want to actually pick these. 
I think I'm leaning towards `project x project` as apposed to `reticle x reticle` or rows, or cols. 

Is anyone even interested in getting info on whatwafer/where their dies come from? Not sure how possible it even would be.","die-sorter_media/waferspace_run1_test-33A08.png",""

Can I get these files that were used in the [stitcher](https://github.com/wafer-space/reticle-stitcher)
tilemap.csv
manifest.csv

Might be nice to just unify some of this","",""
