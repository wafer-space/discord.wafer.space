First off, the SMT tape and reel components have arrived. 

I hadn't realized the 13"" reels come unassembled, which is nice for shipping I guess. 
I'm also not sure anyone would be getting their components on these reels or not. There are a lot of questions in the air about actual yields, but a 7"" reel would *barely fit* so am opting to design with larger reels just in case. 

Got boxes of the pressure sensitive cover tape. I have attached some to some tape and think it should work well. 

We also got a bundle of 7"" reels, they were packed very pretty. This is likely how your dies arrive if you order bare dies.","die-sorter_media/20251223_234922-A0CD3.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251223_235041-75FB3.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251223_234928-E33A8.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251223_235011-D987F.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251223_234939-0223C.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251224_021415-A975C.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251224_021420-6F76C.jpg",""

I have a few chips from the old GF run and they seem to fit well!","die-sorter_media/0012-6ACDE.JPG,die-sorter_media/0016-2FA86.JPG,die-sorter_media/20251223_232305-16CCB.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251223_232053-1252B.jpg",""

Granted I only talked to a few, but they all wanted gel packs basically.","",""
