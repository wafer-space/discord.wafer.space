I had a look at page 3 of the doc, but I'm not sure how you arrived at the numbers of 0, 4, 8mm etc.

The die dimensions are 3932um by 5122um as specified here: https://github.com/wafer-space/reticle-stitcher/blob/105a0e45197eaa245cb68fc87eff127567c4bef6/reticle_stitcher.py#L25

It seems that you specified the raw project dimensions without the sealring on page 4.","",""

I can also share the tilemap and manifest CSV files with you.

However, not all of the designs on wafer.space are open source, some are proprietary. Therefore, I cannot share the complete reticle here.

If you could share your email, I can send you all the files.","",""
