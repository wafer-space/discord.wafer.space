When you guys get a chance can you share some of the outputs from https://github.com/wafer-space/reticle-stitcher
and/or `manifest-wsmpw1.csv` or  `tilemap-wsmpw1.csv` or whatever I can use for die size/project/location/etc..

It probably would be beneficial if whatever this is could also be used to create a dicing plan.
