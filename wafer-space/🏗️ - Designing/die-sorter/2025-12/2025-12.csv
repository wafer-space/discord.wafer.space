We subdivide this area into 40 slots, some are full size, others are smaller.

The photo mask is exposed and moved across the wafer multiple times to cover the whole wafer. wafer.space ordered a fixed number of wafers from GF, which means we end up with a certain number of dies.
Giving you fewer dies won't increase the size of your project, we would have to throw them away as they are produced anyway.

However, we can increase the size of your project by merging two 1x1 slots. This would be possible if wafer.space uses laser dicing (which we don't use for run 1), as otherwise we would cut through your project.

So, yes, it's possible in theory, but it would be more expensive.

PS: For this special first run, we actually duplicated all paid projects so that wafer.space could order less wafers, but can still fullfil the 1000 dies per project. In this case we could have actually doubled the area for your design and you would have received the half amount of dies. However, we still don't use laser dicing ^^","",""
