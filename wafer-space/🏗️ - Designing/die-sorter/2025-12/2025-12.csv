The goal is to support at least 40 tape-and-reel mechanisms, with the ability to add more in the future (including half-width or other variants). To keep things flexible and manageable, I’m avoiding putting actuators on each mechanism. Instead, the plan is to use a base-mounted actuator that can drive each unit as needed.

Since we don’t yet know how many parts each feeder will need to hold, I’m standardizing on 13"" reels so we can handle just about any reasonable tape quantity in one setup.

With 40 feeders, setup time matters. Even one minute per reel turns into an hour very quickly, so minimizing loading effort is an important design consideration.","",""

This design is based on a lever-and-spring-finger mechanism I’ve used successfully in SMT feeders.

While it works well there, I’m concerned it may not have enough grip for a tape-and-reel machine. In addition to moving the tape, it has to deal with cover tape forces and the take-up reel. Additionally as these tapes will be used by others after we're done, we can't have any damage to the tape. 

I built a simple prototype mainly to check fit and get a feel for how it behaves in the real world.","die-sorter_media/reeler_v1_2-B54A1.png,die-sorter_media/20251224_024843-BC327.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251224_024849-25B68.jpg,die-sorter_media/reeler_v1-5D987.png,die-sorter_media/reeler_v1_1-C11EB.png,die-sorter_media/0026-73E50.JPG,die-sorter_media/0023-9E4D7.JPG",""

This version uses a toothed wheel to drive the tape, acting like a ratchet. A spring-loaded drive pushes it forward, and reverse teeth prevent it from backing up on the return stroke.

The current prototypes are very rough and made from inexpensive sheet material, chosen mainly because it’s fast and cheap for early testing (referred to by @Tim 'mithro' Ansell  as “nasty fuzzy particle board stuff” 😂 ).

One issue I’ve noticed is that the drive gear may be a bit small, creating a tighter bend radius than I’d like. That’s something to refine.

So far, this design feels the most promising in terms of grip and overall robustness.","die-sorter_media/reeler_v2_1-897BA.png,die-sorter_media/0027-C49ED.JPG,die-sorter_media/20251224_025232-35B5A.jpg,die-sorter_media/20251224_025242-73F0E.jpg,die-sorter_media/reeler_v2-F1497.png,die-sorter_media/0020-DD288.JPG",""

I also explored an all-gear approach, but this is the least appealing option. Keeping everything aligned and properly indexed would add a lot of complexity, and it doesn’t seem worth the effort compared to the other designs. The feed gear is too big and more.","die-sorter_media/reeler_v3_2-D830E.png,die-sorter_media/0021-8D298.JPG,die-sorter_media/20251224_025028-90E2A.jpg,die-sorter_media/reeler_v3-FDBF4.png,die-sorter_media/reeler_v3_1-EE951.png",""
