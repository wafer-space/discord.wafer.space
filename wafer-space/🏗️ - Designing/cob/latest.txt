I will be taking one more pass at the cob PCB, I will try to be more amenable to changes with this revision. 
Ultimately there are more pins on the die than there are on the mezzanine, so there will be some considerations needed there. 

Afaik we still have not had any real conversations with wirebonders so are still not sure on what they are willing to accept for deviations from the norm. 
I still think that as long as bonding locations and overall form factor remain constant we should be able to have a lot of variations.

The LGA version is temporarily abandoned given concerns over reflowing and types of epoxies after wirebonding.
I have also ordered some 50pin mezzanine connectors to play with for a lower pin count version. The cost for these connectors is quite affordable even at quantity.

Is there a prototype bonding plan for 50pin mezzanine connector somewhere I could take a look? I think I only found a 70pin version in the repo.

Sorry, no, It's just something I've been talking about doing.

There is no padring yet, so not sure what anything will look like.

For retro DIP40 I am gravitating to use primarily North and South side (32 pins) of the padring and the rest put as close to the corner as possible.

Dunno if that might be a stupid idea?

The reasoning is to keep sides as empty as possible in case LGA comes back and I could keep it narrow.
