Looks like a few GND vias are missing, so there’s a bit of rework to do, but it’s 95% finished

If your board is on github, you can stick that link into this site and get a web view of the board. 

Here is an example of a friend's board. https://kicanvas.org/?github=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCarlFK%2Fgeebee%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fdell7212%2Fkicad%2Fbgpogo

If you post it, I'll take a look at it if you'd like.
