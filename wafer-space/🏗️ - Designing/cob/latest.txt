I’ve wired everything up now. @GoranMahovlic  helped me a lot, especially with the SDRAM wiring and the connector. I don’t have much experience—this is my first real board—so I’m going to check the signals again and double-check the connector pinout. Then I’ll send it to a fab/assembly shop for soldering. I really wanted to finish this so I can continue with my next Linux SoC, StealthV.
