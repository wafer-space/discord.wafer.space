I don’t have much experience—this is my first real board—so I’m going to check the signals again and double-check the connector pinout. Then I’ll send it to a fab/assembly shop for soldering. I really wanted to finish this so I can continue with my next Linux SoC, StealthV.","cob_media/Screenshot_from_2026-01-09_23-33-02-BC77C.png,cob_media/Screenshot_from_2026-01-09_23-33-24-68B7C.png",""
