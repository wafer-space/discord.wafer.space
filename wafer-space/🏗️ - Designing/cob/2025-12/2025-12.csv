1. Just the extra cost, it would require more masks and processes.
2. It seems the people who do the bumping are not interested in the quantities we're doing. 
3. Everyone would have to agree on a standard pinout. (I don't see this one as a dealbreaker, but poses some issues when we try to subdivide dies into smaller forms, or probably worse going in the other direction for a larger than standard size like you were asking for for more sram.) 

It certainly is something that would be very useful if we can devise a way to make it work under all these constraints.","",""

But you'd have to know the pins you could bridge (VCC, VDD, etc.) 
This thing was made just to fit whatever anyone did, and more to just make something to play with than something that may actually be useful.","",""

The COB is the small 14mm x 16mm pcb that is on the top. 
Your die would be wirebonded to that and then you can do whatever you want after, but don't have to find a way to wirebond yourself as it's not as accessible as PCBA","","😮 (1)"

These were designed respecting the pad choices chosen by Tiny Tapeout as they had the most ready designs available when we started all this. 
You're also welcome to design your own COB chip as long as you respect the pad locations on the die, the wirebond pads on the COB PCB, and the location of the mezzanine connector. But going outside the standards will leave all the remaining details to you.","",""
