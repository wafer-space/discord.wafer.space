Order early, order often. 
JLCPCB and others have this global standard shipping, and it's like $5 US 
I would order what you have there, just so you can hold it and look at it. 
Otherwise looks pretty good so far 👍","","❤️ (1)"

I’m in Germany as well, so it’d be convenient. Maybe @Tim 'mithro' Ansell , @Matt Venn , or @psychogenic  has a contact there and we can do our PCB order through them.","",""
