That’s why I cringe a bit when I see people just have CEN permanently selected on the SRAM macros because I’m pretty sure that that is why I have such incredible heat output.

😮

That could’ve been communicated beforehand, though.

I still hope that half of that heat output was caravel


[12/30/2025 02:51] logic_anarchy
Why do you think that?


[12/30/2025 02:51] tholin
Because its a whole RISC-V SoC with a bunch of SRAM macros that are also just leaving CEN always active.

How was it at 30 MHz? Do you also have data on the heat output, like how much power your design consumed?


[12/30/2025 02:54] tholin
At 25MHz, its....fine

Do you have data on how much power your board consumed?


[12/30/2025 02:57] tholin
No

I have to sleep now. Thanks for the information.

I have no multimeter that doesn’t max out at 100mA
