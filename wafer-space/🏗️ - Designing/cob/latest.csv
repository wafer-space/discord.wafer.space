Still quite paranoid and it's on my list of things to re-check before submission, but I thought this was less painful overall because I can use the correct pad names in IO constraints etc.","",""

All of the I/O pads in gf180mcu are the same width. So, when LibreLane places them equidistant from each other, you will always get the same bondpad loactions.","",""

I could add one based on the XOR of the pad layer. However, this would probably only be for the second shuttle, as it requires information from the online platform on whether the user has selected the CoB option or not.","",""
