According to the dimensions, it still fits underneath the connector. I would have preferred a DIP-4 package so the oscillator could be easily replaced, but it seems I now have to use a 30 MHz SMD oscillator and place it under the connector to keep the trace to the ASIC short. Ideally, the oscillator would have been mounted on top of the connector PCB.","",""

If I make a standalone version I’d probably go for the chip I mentioned before that buffers the output so trace length isn’t important - or see what other people have done and worked 🙂","",""
