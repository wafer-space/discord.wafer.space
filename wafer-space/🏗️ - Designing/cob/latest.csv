Le'ts just continue the discussion here if that's alright with you. 
Over the break or sometime, I camy up with this. Influenced in no small part to the work you have done. 

If you'd like to take a stab at making another version I would be happy to see it. 
These are some design rules https://drive.google.com/file/d/1touEQHWAOTon_98TdiVLKKqsQ8RJJ1tP/view
Assume the die is 0.75mm thick. I have attached some drawings I sent a dicing house to get us some sample wafers diced for testing.","cob_media/image-1B14C.png,cob_media/wafer_dicing_detail_rev2-03990.pdf",""

Basically I would like for the cob to fit in between headers that are spaced at 0.6"" like we would have for a DIP type chip. 
The carrier board would be 0.1"" wider than what you see in these pictures.
Let me know if you have any questions, I'll try my best to answer. 

Also, don't take the above picture as gospel, I only spent a few minutes playing around and just shared is all. 
Thanks and good luck!","",""

And @xianglin_pu's design was a derivative of mine I believe. 

Was well thought out. Thank you","",""
