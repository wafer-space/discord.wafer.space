On one hand we just have the sheer number of pins and I am not sure how  many wire bonds @Tim 'mithro' Ansell is wanting to let people have. 

That said, the picture here has 78pins and there is some room for some other things as well--and/or instead. 
Instead could also just be testpoints. They don't need to be brought down to the main PCB board and can remain on the COB 

Another idea, is to have some solderable jumpers or 0R resistors that can bridge a pin from the COB to the pcb. 

And finally if something like the solderable jumper is a viable option, is there some way to have the same effect on the die itself with a MUX or the like. I am trying to wrap my head around the actual utility here. There are *user_pins* and *power_pins* I can understand the desire for more pins, but don't know what that means in practice and if it could/should be more *shared_pins*

The general idea is that COB will be panelized in ~100mmx100mm panels. Some components can be put on the pcb before (or after) the die like connectors--mezzanine most likely--and decoupling caps reducing the number of pins that may need to connect to the motherboard like TinyTapeout and @tnt with high pinout demands would like.

DIP like @Tholin has been working on are still available too, but didn't really have a place on this sheet I don't think

My name is Andrew and my team and I are very excited to start work on porting the MOSbius chip (mosbius.org) to GF180 with the wafer.space project. I have just now started working on this project so please forgive my ignorance in the following questions.
1) I recall from a previous email chain that @Tim 'mithro' Ansell had kindly let us know that we can use our own padframe. Is that still true for the COB option ($8500), or is there a default padframe we would need to follow? 
2) If we can use our own padframe, I’m assuming we would also need to design the wire bond as well?
3) For the default padframe that @tnt mentioned above with the 56 “user io” bond pads, can that be generated with the following template? https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template

We just got into the wafer.space design, so excuse me if I ask questions that have been answered. Looked around a bit but I am left with the following question. 

I was talking to @asc and he mentioned that you are developing a template with 74 pads; ( 20 + 17 ) x 2

The reticle is sqrt(20) so about 4.5mm on the side (although maybe the reticle is rectangular). In any case 20 pads on 4 mm would mean 200um center-to-center pitch. That sounds large. Obviously we do not need to push is to 50um which likely might not work for COB, but what is the guideline for the COB?

What is the center-to-center pitch on the PCB pads?

74 pads would work for out MOSbius chip (https://mosbius.org) , but more pins can always be put to very good use for our application ... 

Finally, we would like a version which is dual in line style so we can put it in a breadboard. You can see our current PCB (with a chip in a package) attached.  

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell  So how would we go about this? Do all the designs in the run use the same # pins and positions for the COB at 8,500. Or if we do the designwork of the PCB, can we make our own, or does that come at a higher cost?

Many thanks! Looking forward to be part of this exciting opportunity for cheap 'packaged' silicon. For those that have paid for chip packaging they probably realize that silicon cost is one thing, packaging is a whole other painful expense ...

Yes, there is the default template which has 74 pads, 54 of which are used for signals. 
The $8,500 USD option with CoB packaging can only be used with this exact padframe, since the setup cost is shared across all designs.

While you should not change the position of any pads, you can change the pad types. For example, all of the 54 pads could be used for analog. The remaining 20 pads are used for power and ground and should not be changed, since they will be connected to the power/ground rings of the CoB footprint on the PCB.

If you do your own packaging, you could fit more pads into the padframe, or remove the padframe completely - this is up to you.

I believe there are different daughter boards in development in the #cob channel.

**70pin Mezzanine:** I really think that version would be great, but I am concerned about users being able to get their own components for the mating side. Availability seems very low for this size

**Castellated:** This is another viable option, but this means that users must either supply the COB to a PCBA at the time of assembly, or try to solder this chip on their motherboard themselves. This is doable but ~70 pin castellated solders gets old fast. 

**2row 1.27 headers:** This is my latest iteration. This option has all the pins broken out (76) so users can do whatever they like. The picture on the right can probably be wave soldered, reducing the cost as much as possible because things add up fast when there's a lot of pins. 

Personally, I would like to see the 50pin mezzanine connector version stay on the smallest footprint version for anyone wanting to use these in application (not sure if there are any) but that option allows a PCBA to assemble an entire board and user does not need to supply anything, then can just plug in themselves easily. This decision is based on price and availability as well. 

@asc, I don't know what where you'd land on desires here, but an option as well for you would be the 50pin mezzanine and a bunch of testpad/breakout type areas where you could attach a probe for any pin that is not part of the 50 on the connector. 

*We don't know the variability granted by the wirebonders. Ideally the PCB portion could be anything and as long as the pads are all in the same positions, granting @asc and others more pins taken from the power rails needed for @tnt*

I would still like to suggest to have more signal pins. I am not sure why you are using so many VSS pins. Now I might be missing something in terms of the limitations w.r.t. COB bonding, but 10 GNDs out of 74 is a lot, in particular for those of us who are not going after high speed or RF designs (which are going to be challenging in GF180MCU anyway). 

We need 68 pins (and preferrably more) for MOSbius. But I do not think we are unique in the ""need for pins"". I did a quick area estimate planning exercise yesterday -- see below -- and we have tons and tons of spare area and could put in a lot of functions, but just need more pins ... That is in part due the nature of our MOSbius design, but is true for many designs by starting designers where you want a good number of pins for debug. We saw the same in the chipathon. 

Can we set up a zoom call to discuss. I am on pacific time but can accommodate times the work for US or EU.

 * *Ultimately* my thoughts don't really matter, the only ones who really do are the PCBA house & the customers. If the result is under budget, actually can be manufactured and makes people happy then it is perfectly fine by me.
 * In terms of PCBA negotiation, PCB Way is the furthest along, then Seeed and JLCPCB the furthest behind. We should make sure the PCBs are manufacturable at PCB Way as P0.
 * I'm happy to have multiple PCBs and pad frame designs -- 4-6 is fine, >10 is probably too many.
 * I really want to have at least one option which is DIP for breadboard compatible usage.
 * I have square & symmetrical designs, just gives one another way to screw things up.
 * The **only** silicon we have today uses either Mehdi/OpenFASoC or the caravel padframe. Hence to test the cob wire bonding before we get back Run 1 silicon we need some designs which are compatible with that. I think we **do** really need to test this whole process before Run 1 gets back.

- @peterkinget  Personally I would like to keep my just one LGA pattern but would be happy to create a bond pad version for you all. Let me know what you have in mind and I can try. 
- In this case I can connect some nets back up if you'd like @tnt?

Your design looks nice. Where do you think you are out of spec? 

How big are your bondpads on the chip? They seem bigger than my 100um pads at a 200um pitch. I left a 1.5mm spacing around the die to statisfy the 1.5 x die thickness clearance (die are typically way thinner than 1 mm, don't know if the dies are backlapped in GF180); then I placed a row of 200x100 bondfingers (PCB side) at a 200um pitch on top. Not sure if the PCB house can support that, but it seemed to satisfy the requirements in the doc that @Tim 'mithro' Ansell shared above. If the PCB can support, then we can have straight wires, or am I missing something?

Why are some of your bondfingers bigger?

What CAD are you using for the PCB design? I attach a PDF export of an Altium webpage https://resources.altium.com/p/pcb-design-rules-chip-board-layout?utm_source=chatgpt.com. That tool seems to have a nice COB built in tool. In any case, notice how they rotate the pads to be aligned with the bondwire.

I'm in Chicago - UTC-6. And you?

> Your design looks nice. Where do you think you are out of spec? 
The minimum distance to a pad based on the height of the die. (just a couple of the ground wires.)

> How big are your bondpads on the chip? They seem bigger than my 100um pads at a 200um pitch.
If you're talking about what you see above, those are **not** the real pad sizes. they're just drawings for reference. 
I also am not well versed enough to answer some of the other questions, you'll have to ask someone else. 

> Why are some of your bondfingers bigger?
In an effort to get some more pads broken out for you all, I talked to tnt about breaking some nets up so you could use them for your purposes. In that we wanted to keep the traces as short as possible so there is a via directly in those. 
I feel I will be going back and changing that portion as it's less necessary now. We'll see. Long story short is they don't have to be.

I'm using KiCad

This would be kindof a pain in Kicad and I don't think this is necessary. You're welcome to design your own. 

It seems like you have the same layout as the TT layout with 74 bonds.

It took us over a year to establish a flow that didn't break most of our assemblies :( This was a combination of company negotiation time and lots of surprise temperature incompatibilities. 
* You will likely find wirebond/COB houses and SMT assembly houses who will each want to do their process first on a bare PCB. I have set up prototyping runs in both situations, and only once found a company that could do both (at higher cost than the two phases individually, unfortunately). I have not gone back to that company because initial project setup took months and over 150 emails. Then that sales engineer retired and I loathed the idea of explaining our assembly to another person. I think they contracted out the COB portion but at least they were responsible for ensuring order of operations.
* Advantages to SMT going first: get the high temperature steps out of the way. We were using transparent epoxy that swelled in high temperature, ripping off bondwires. As others have already mentioned, opaque epoxies can generally withstand high solder temperatures.
* Advantages to COB going first: wirebond heads work easiest when the bonding surface is flat and there's nothing for the bond head to crash in to. Also they are often attached via vacuum chuck which cannot seal if there are parts on the backside of the board. Custom chucks can be fabricated to enable vacuum seal, at increased NRE cost.
* We had some designs packaged QFN but the hassle and cost wasn't ultimately worth it. Packages were not bonded correctly in some cases, with no way to inspect the bonds' correctness via microscope.
* COB houses will often require PCBs with ENEPIG or soft bondable gold surface finishes which increase PCB cost and mfg time significantly. Some COB houses are fine with more widely available ENIG but with more risk to yield.","","👍 (1)"

I just had a meeting with @peterkinget and @asc and they were telling me about their needs. 
I have changed the padframe layout a bit and wanted to run it past you. 
The intent here is for anyone using the 74 pad layout can customize it to their needs, but the actual wirebond layout will remain unchanged between versions. 
The example here I have your GND pins all tied together and we can also tie together VDD and other nets too if you'd like. 

@peterkinget I have uploaded the latest versions. The newest padframe footprint is also here.

I have a pretty strong feeling this will be one that makes it to the end. 
If you want a motherboard *stick it on there*
If you want a DIP package *stick it on there*
If you want a breadboardable *stick it on there*
If you want a test board *stick it on there*
If you need revisions *stick it on there*, revise, then *stick it on there*
If you want other people to design motherboards for you, send them one so they can *stick it on there*
If you're worried about wirebond failures *stick it on there* and test without worries

Side benefits, PCBA house does not need to stock these for you and/or you do not need to ship them to them when you need more motherboards

The extra cost will probably be < $0.30 but may be washed out if the wirebond house only has to deal with a single format. 
If half a run wants COB that's 20k. Setup costs trend towards zero, and 1k chips almost perfectly fit on a 7"" reel making a PCB changeout also low/no cost. 
@db mentioned above that some of the wirebonders use a vacuum chuck to hold the parts. If we think we want to move the bottom traces into an inner layer and accommodate some decoupling we may want to consider that now before tooling is made (even if we never do)

Is there anything I missed?

Based on notes like above about 150 emails between @db and their wirebonder, this is something we want to avoid. And given the most I’ve seen for passing bond layouts has been glorified napkin sketches. We don’t want to be doing this all the time. 
The overall layout here has 74 bondpads and 70 pins that can be brought through the mezzanine connector. 
Again, it’s my suspicion, but keeping things the same will pay in dividends. 
I think the process looks something like this. 

### COB PCB 
PCB houses already deal with variety, I don’t see why this would be different. The current layout is a 7x6 grid (42) dies per panel. 25 panels is 1050 COB. We will likely share a few basic designs and all most would do is change the silkscreen to their liking. 
From @Tim 'mithro' Ansell side, he is looking at purchasing 10s of thousands of these connectors making for happy conversations with suppliers. With Crowd Supply’s connections with Mouser, there may be a way to get them to stock the mating components. 

### Glue and Die Placement
All the die are the same size. If there is a mechanical solution for adding the glue (I believe there is) having the same layout for everything will make them very happy. Cost is inversely proportional to happy. Furthermore, from my estimation, roughly 1k die fit on a 7” reel and the die can likely be placed by standard pick and place machinery, further increasing happiness.","",""
"756011607603019777","anfroholic","2025-10-19T00:30:53.1420000+00:00","### Wirebonding itself
**Wirebonding:** Like I said above, it seems like wirebonds are identified by napkin sketches. Even moving 1 pad creates 74 unhappys. I am going to go out and and say that in the beginning at least it’s going to be cheaper for someone who only wants 50pins and a 50pin mezzanine ($0.20 cheaper per connector) to actually get all 74 wirebonds even if they remain unused. 
**Vacuum Chuck** @db  had mentioned above they may—likely—use a vacuum chuck. For our needs they will likely need to create a custom harness, decreasing hundreds of happy every time there is something new. In the design I have allocated a space we can keep clear for any number of components that can fit that area. *Stack height can  be changed on motherboard side if needed*

### Goober
Once the wirebonding is completed, the dies need to be protected. There are machines that can place the epoxy. Again, if all the panels are the same, there is no setup cost, increasing happiness. 
@Matt Venn shared a table in one of his recent videos about where all the cost is compared across different quantities. If there is an LGA version, I suggest it *still* use the same layout. If @Tim 'mithro' Ansell  can get the throughput enough that he’s making runs every week—which would be super cool!!—I bet the cost for this would drop below $0.50 or even less for some variations. 
Enough happiness to go around.","",""

Both have 35 pins on each side. Since we cannot know what the pinout will be from the die, we can't really pour grounds, but would be simple enough for someone to change if they did want it. (I also feel like someone would want to label pins as well?)

Judging only from the TT layout and the MOSbius layouts they're both using the *standard* 74 pads on the die.
MOSbius wants access to as many pins as possible, while TT wants many more ground pads--and some decoupling.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but users can choose to use any pad in any way they wish on the die?
Finally, *personally.* I think that using a mezzanine connector will be a good choice for us all going forward. That leaves 70pins that can make it down to a motherboard.

A lot of it is logistical. The LGA package can ride along with this as well with no changes. 
Some back of the envelope math expecting 1000 pcs is:

panelized mezzanine cob pcbs would need 25 panels (a stack <20mm high)
panelized castellated board from [here](https://discord.com/channels/1361349522684510449/1408134567491145728/1429676570972393594) would need 70 pcbs (a stack ~60mm high) 
And the last breadboard version would be **170** pcb panels (a stack ~**275mm** high)

We still should see what the wirebonders have to say, but logistically, if we can keep the panels small we get a lot of gains and think they'd be more willing to work with us. 
Also having a standard that's easily customizable and approachable has some benefits of themselves.

I'm working to get some padframe/ cob/ wirebonding standards that will be offered compiled for an upcomming update. 
Obviously there is the 74pad version with the 70pin mezzanine. I think that's been pretty solidified. 

I am looking for anything else, and what we think people would want. @Tholin you seem to be the only other one who has expressed interest in another--that being a dip version. Is this what you want? Would you be opposed to having a dip version that looks like these versions above, where the actual dip layout is in fact a carrier? https://discord.com/channels/1361349522684510449/1408134567491145728/1431637886314352834

If we're looking for some other version that would be lower cost, what would you all think of a 50pin mezzanine, this could have 55pads or so? The cost difference from 40pin to 50pin is basically 0, so real difference is offers from wirebonder. 

Sharing the source and production files will already be done. But also have a relationship to Mouser through CS so if we wanted them to stock panels of DIP carrier boards that fit our *to be determined standard* I'm sure this is something that can happen if we think there will be some kind of demand. 

@mole99 I'm pretty sure there are some other files somewhere that map the [config](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template/blob/main/librelane/config.yaml) to the actual pad locations. Having another padframe obviously has some overhead, do you want to speak for a second standard?
