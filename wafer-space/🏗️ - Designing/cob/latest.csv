Similar to @Tholin I am interested in the DIP PCB.

DIP is for Z80. That means only 40 pins all digital 5V. Classical DIP40.

My preferences:
1) first would be **small LGN** pcb as long as it can be soldered onto DIP PCB without destroying the wirebonding.
2) second would be binding chip directly to **DIP40 PCB** where I can route GND **(to pin 29)** and VDD** (to pin 11 of the DIP40)**.

Mezzanine - while very flexible I am worried that it would make the final package look ""weird"" and too high, also I still not sure what would that mean to the final cost. So for Z80 I would say it as a Plan C.

**Just to clarify, is LGN option still on the table?**","",""

I am trying to keep compatibility with DIP-40 ceramic carriers where those connections are fixed.","",""

Did they have special ceramic packages for them? (unfortunately I don't have Z80 in ceramic for inspection)","",""
