Would / could that be compatible with 50pin mezzanine layout you are thinking about?

That sounds close to what I had in mind. 
Like I said above to @Tholin I think for now the safest bet could be to consider this a subset of the standard wirebonding frame. 
I have ordered the board you see posted here and I'll be taking another pass at it and probably be shrinking some parts making the whole thing more narrow. 
Also hopefully soon we will have open dialogs with wirebonders and we'll get a lot more info about what's best/possible/etc.

Could you explain why do you say that it is a *subset* of a wirebonding scheme?

I think I see all the pads from the chip pad frame (at least @mole99’s template) exposed and bondable. I am I missing something?

I mean (and this is still my opinion only) that toolchains could remain more simple if we only change a few things at a time with the wirebonders, so the wirebonding frame would still have bonds at the same locations. Again, I don't know a lot of things, and what constitutes *different* as far as their pattern matching and other toolchains consider the same or not. 
With the deadline looming, I don't know how many variations there will be in this run. But will try to keep everyone updated as I go along.
