Hello, I am really late to the party, just finished reading the channel contents. On the plus side Z80 is all dandy and passing prechecks without violations.

Similar to @Tholin I am interested in the DIP PCB.

DIP is for Z80. That means only 40 pins all digital 5V. Classical DIP40.

My preferences:
1) first would be **small LGN** pcb as long as it can be soldered onto DIP PCB without destroying the wirebonding.
2) second would be binding chip directly to **DIP40 PCB** where I can route GND **(to pin 29)** and VDD** (to pin 11 of the DIP40)**.

Mezzanine - while very flexible I am worried that it would make the final package look "weird" and too high, also I still not sure what would that mean to the final cost. So for Z80 I would say it as a Plan C.

**Just to clarify, is LGN option still on the table?**

On a PCB, you can route any pad on the COB footprint to any pin on the headers - that’s no problem.
I am trying to keep compatibility with DIP-40 ceramic carriers where those connections are fixed.


[11/21/2025 16:38] tholin
So I had to move around some VDD/VSS pads


[11/21/2025 16:39] tholin
And can thus no longer use the mezzanine breakout as it makes assumptions about the locations of the ground pads and wires them all to a ground plane.


[11/21/2025 16:39] tholin
So, I’m also interested in other options.


[11/21/2025 16:40] rzioma
Just to clarify VDD/VSS pads - you had to move them on the chip ring layout or outside (on PCB)?


[11/21/2025 16:40] tholin
The chip ring layout

I looked at your reference to DIP-40 ceramic carrier and I wonder how did they managed to put Z80 in ceramic back in the day, because they have VDD/GND not on 40/20 pins.

Did they have special ceramic packages for them? (unfortunately I don't have Z80 in ceramic for inspection)


[11/21/2025 16:48] tholin
The ceramic carrier makes no assumptions about the location of the power pins. It simply breaks the 40 pins out to 40 bonding pads.


[11/21/2025 16:49] tholin
There is a metal plane at the base of the cavity, but you have to bond it to the ground pin yourself by running a wire from the carrier’s bond bad to the plane.


[11/21/2025 16:49] tholin
At least, that is how I understand it.


[11/21/2025 16:49] tholin
But I still had to customize my die’s padring since I am replicating existing chips and thus need specific ground/power connections.


[11/21/2025 16:50] rzioma
There is that track on the top for the ground. I guess you are talking about that one.
