Ultimately there are more pins on the die than there are on the mezzanine, so there will be some considerations needed there. 

Afaik we still have not had any real conversations with wirebonders so are still not sure on what they are willing to accept for deviations from the norm. 
I still think that as long as bonding locations and overall form factor remain constant we should be able to have a lot of variations.","",""

I have also ordered some 50pin mezzanine connectors to play with for a lower pin count version. The cost for these connectors is quite affordable even at quantity.

Dunno if that might be a stupid idea?

The reasoning is to keep sides as empty as possible in case LGA comes back and I could keep it narrow.","",""
