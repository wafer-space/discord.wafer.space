Are there any considerations for wirebonding > 70 pins? My design will be roughly 128 pins. I'm swamped currently with the tapeout finalizing my design, but I would be willing to look into doing a dual 70 pin mezzanine connector OR a larger pin mezzanine connector if that might help after the tapeout.","",""

There are larger pin versions, but 70 seemed good at that fit the needs of most at the time. 
There were conversations about using multiple connectors, but there were concerns over tolerances and like I said above, 70pins was adequate.","",""
