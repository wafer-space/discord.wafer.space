Like I said above to @Tholin I think for now the safest bet could be to consider this a subset of the standard wirebonding frame. 
I have ordered the board you see posted here and I'll be taking another pass at it and probably be shrinking some parts making the whole thing more narrow. 
Also hopefully soon we will have open dialogs with wirebonders and we'll get a lot more info about what's best/possible/etc.","cob_media/image-81CA6.png",""

I think I see all the pads from the chip pad frame (at least @mole99’s template) exposed and bondable. I am I missing something?","",""

Again, I don't know a lot of things, and what constitutes *different* as far as their pattern matching and other toolchains consider the same or not. 
With the deadline looming, I don't know how many variations there will be in this run. But will try to keep everyone updated as I go along.","",""
