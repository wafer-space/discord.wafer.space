So you have to match the pin locations to the original chip essentially.","",""

"220639106915368960","tholin","2025-11-21T16:56:32.0970000+00:00","This could technically be solved by creating a ""dumb"" version of that breakout that just routes each pad to a pin on the mezzanine without making any assumptions, with the PCB ground plane unconnected to any chip pads and routed to a spare mezzanine pin. This I *could* use for prototyping, as long as I also still get raw dies for my ceramic carrier experiments!","","👍 (1)"

(while keeping bonding pattern in the same way as “normal” LGN if it reduced the price / headache. Some internal pads would simply left unconnected for some pads)","",""

"538398807986274304","rzioma","2025-11-21T17:17:38.4000000+00:00","The reasoning here is that it might not fit on DIP otherwise.

Classic DIP has less than 14 mm on the top and “fake” PCB DIPs might have protruding pins from below","",""
