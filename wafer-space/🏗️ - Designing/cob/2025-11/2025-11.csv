*edit* also add `in: cob` as it's in this channel","","👍 (1)"

It looks like there are exactly 64 GPIO pins free which means I'm two short for the design to work! I'll read later and see if I can change some things around my design, I'd like to use the standard wirebond option if I can make it work.

Scratch that it looks like a little less I just eyeballed it.","",""

The part (for now) that seems most important is to keep the wirebonding pads (qty74) and the 74 pads in the default padring, then also the actual PCB to keep the 14x16mm size and the 70pin mezzanine. 
@xianglin_pu and the Mosbius team have created their own routing to gain some extra pins by not having so many vss/vcc etc.

I'm assuming it's the mapping from the pads to the PCB, are you saying it's possible for us to design our own routing for the PCB and just use the pads as needed?","",""

Keep in mind that I'll likely be taking another pass and there will be some small changes, so you may want to hold off on designing something now, but overall yes, you can have your own routing on the PCB itself.","",""

After the tapeout I'll see where everyone is at and go from there, I haven't had time to look at the PCB design yet anyways. I'll give this channel a read later and hopefully be a little more informed. Thanks for the discussion.","","👍 (1)"
