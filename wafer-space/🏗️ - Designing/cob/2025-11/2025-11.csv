Now things are *landscape* but the numbering fits convention a little better. 
Conventions are hard and not everyone will always agree on things. 

Another one that has thrown me many times using CAD packages is *top*

Americans think of the screen as a window to a virtual world and top is Z+ and does not matter which way *you* are facing
Germans have *top* as Y+ as if you're imagining the virtual world extending from the tip of your nose. 
It's hard to say that one is *the correct* way of doing things.","cob_media/image-F41AB.png",""
