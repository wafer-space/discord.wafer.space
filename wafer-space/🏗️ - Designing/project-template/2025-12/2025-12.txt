Thank you so much!

@Tholin - Some kinda related terrible ideas:
 * There was a bunch of discussion around seeing if we could make the silicon be something like really bad/inefficient infrared LEDs due to silicon being mostly transparent to IR. (I think @Ethan Mahintorabi and @BreakingTaps where part of that discussion but might have it confused with being infrared sensors -- might have instead been @digshadow and bunnie?) -- I wonder if you could make a logo that glows? (or maybe the metal just blocks the light?) 😛 
 * I wonder if you could make the logo be some type of capacitor or connected to the power rails so the logo does something 😛
