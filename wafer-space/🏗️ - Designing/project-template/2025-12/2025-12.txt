📢 Major performance update!

A long-standing issue in the KLayout DRC deck has been discovered and fixed 🎉
Many thanks to Matthias for [investigating the issue and providing a solution](https://github.com/KLayout/klayout/issues/2241#issuecomment-3612915372).
This reduces the time taken by KLayout DRC for one tested design from several hours to just 1.5h ⏱️

- PDK [1.4.1](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu/releases/tag/1.4.1)
  - Fix the connectivity setup in KLayout DRC.
  - Check for both P/N-type diodes in the KLayout antenna script. (thanks @tnt!)

Make sure to update your project and your local precheck with the latest PDK:

- Project template [1.2.3](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template/releases/tag/1.2.3)
- Precheck [1.4.2](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck/releases/tag/1.4.2)

Awesome, my current precheck is still not finished after > 27 hours and was stuck for most of the time in the connectivity setup 😆

Well, let me know how it goes 😉

BTW, running antenna check pre-fill GDS also seemed to speed it up a bit FWIW.
