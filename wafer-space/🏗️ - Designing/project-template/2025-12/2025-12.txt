(trying a run now with 500 um just as an experiment)

need to check my notes but if that's the same max_wire_length that I set, it made things much worse. I tried 50 (lol), 500 and 1000 and in all cases the design was notably worse and sometimes failed routing/congestion


[12/01/2025 17:15] _luke_w_
ha


[12/01/2025 17:18] polyfractal
ah ok, so I set `DESIGN_REPAIR_MAX_WIRE_LENGTH` in the config, not sure if that ends up being the same as the CTS setting


[12/01/2025 17:18] polyfractal
i assume not


[12/01/2025 17:19] _luke_w_
ah yeah that is something different I believe -- that is a limit on all of the datapath wires that is applied after global placement

500 um is barely enough to get across an SRAM (440 um wide I believe)

I looked at my clock tree and the first net has a routed length of over 3.5 mm which is long enough to see from space

🤞 it works!

this last month has been the steepest learning curve of my life haha 😂

ASIC design is like waging war. It is exhausting and brutal.

seemed to increase my clock skew by about 1.5 ns so I don't necessarily recommend this 😅

I had  M3.2b violations yesterday, but @Leo Moser (mole99) told me to change DENSITY from 30 to 30.1 and it is gone - lol

My Intel i9 PC has been crunching LibreLAN for weeks – this is going to be expensive. Electricity in Germany is among the most expensive in the world.
