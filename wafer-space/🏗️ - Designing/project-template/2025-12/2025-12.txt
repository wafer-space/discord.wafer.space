Good catch. Thanks for pointing that out. Maybe we find some time to fix this. But probably not until the next run.
Anyway, only the smaller designs are connected to the MUX. The bigger designs are running simultaneously. Therefore, adding reset overrides probably won't significantly affect the chip temperature. It still would be pretty hot. 😅
