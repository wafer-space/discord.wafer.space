actually I do have a tech map file to map DFFEs and sync set/clear flops as scan flops, which other people could use to improve QoR on their designs, so there might be a lot more `sdffrnq_4` in the future 🙂 https://github.com/Wren6991/RISCBoy-180/blob/main/librelane/gf180_scanflop_map.v

the only reason I don't recommend using that right now is to get good results you have to disable hold checks on the Q->D path, which I am 99% sure is fine since Q is stable when D is selected, but I'd like to be the guinea pig for one tapeout
