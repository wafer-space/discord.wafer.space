After improving my in-efficient RTL I did manage to fit 23 servs on a design. 🏁

Scales into a half-width slot too with just 9 cores

Can you create a project on the platform for that one too? Maybe there's some space left :)

hm a last minute GDS art addition is now triggering MT.1  ("min. metaltop width : 0.44µm") and MT.2a ("min. metaltop spacing : 0.46µm")  DRC errors. Any ideas or try regenerating with a slightly different size?

Yeah I just had the same thing because a hole in the metal generated by the image script left two corners touching

I just opened it up in klayout and squished the hole, hopefully that fixes it


[12/03/2025 21:51] _luke_w_
(apparently `klayout -e` is the magic flag required to actually let you edit anything)


[12/03/2025 21:51] greg.hashtag.9468
It's in and passed the current pre-check 👍

👌

yeah that looks like my issues. i'm not great with klayout, how did you close the hole? Just draw a new polygon to fill it, or did you edit the existing polygon?


[12/03/2025 21:54] greg.hashtag.9468
The script used for the waferspace logo does a DRC check. But doesn't grep/show errors the DRC found. You have to dig into the .xml report, and look under the <items> tree
So I had a similar issue on my logo art


[12/03/2025 21:58] polyfractal
aha, that's good to know for a faster check. cheers!


[12/03/2025 21:58] _luke_w_
ah. I saw it ran a DRC in the Makefile, didn't see that it didn't propagate an exit code 😅  thanks Greg

Btw. you can load the DRC results using the Marker Browser in KLayout.
