If you're still getting the same error, you can send me a repo/branch so I can take a look.

`CTS_CLK_MAX_WIRE_LENGTH` only constraints the wire from the clock input pin to the clock root buffer. So it would only shift the whole clock tree, as I understand it.

😮

Yes, there was a strange violation where a trace would be too close to one of the SRAMs.
Just reroll the RNG dice! 😁

yeah I looked at the TCL and it seems to be a post-CTS repair step, doesn't do anything during CTS

👌

Also the related `CTS_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_BUFFERS` seems to do nothing at all

> -distance_between_buffers: Distance (in microns) between buffers that cts should use when creating the tree. When using this parameter, the clock tree algorithm is simplified and only uses a fraction of the segments from the LUT.

Doesn't sound too useful? But I would have at least expected a change.

oh and `CTS_TOLERANCE` from OpenLANE was removed 😅

I have a weird long clock branch that contains my SRAM, processor register files (which have clock gates due to latches) and nothing else. I was hoping to segment the clock nets a bit more and bring the SRAMs onto the same branch as the logic


[12/01/2025 19:00] _luke_w_
but I might stop messing with CTS for now

When we complete the tapeout, I’ll be so happy to have my old life back.

Fighting with CTS is no fun. This place is not a place of honour.
By the way, what does your clock tree look like before and after SPEF extraction? Is there a significant mismatch?
