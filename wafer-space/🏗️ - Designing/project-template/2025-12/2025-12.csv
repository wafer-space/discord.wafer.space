I don't know if anyone is validating / checking that aspect and it is really easily to make output of tools like Yosys non-deterministic/reproducible. https://reproducible-builds.org/ goes through a lot of what it takes to make things reproducible.","",""

But if you run on different platforms, it might not be. ( And then of course different version could produce different results obviously ).","",""
