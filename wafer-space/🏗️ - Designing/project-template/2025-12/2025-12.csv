klayout -b -zz -r ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.tech/klayout/tech/drc/filler_generation/fill_all.rb -rd input=chip_top.gds -rd output=chip_top_filled.gds.

Now that the filler scripts have been updated, could you please let me know whether this command should also be updated (for example, by adding any additional options)? Thanks!","",""
