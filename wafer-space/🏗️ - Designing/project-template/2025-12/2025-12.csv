```
librelane-explore: ## Run synthesis exploration
    librelane librelane/config.yaml --pdk ${PDK} --pdk-root ${PDK_ROOT} --manual-pdk --last-run --flow SynthesisExploration
.PHONY: librelane-explore
```

And then run `make librelane-explore` it will try all 9 strategies and tell you which is best (though it's just synthesis timing)","","😮 (2),🙏 (2)"
