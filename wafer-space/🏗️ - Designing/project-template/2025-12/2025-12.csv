Any benefits of going 0.5 x 0.5 at all?","",""

You could use the 0.5x1 or 1x0.5 slots instead of the 1x1 slot.
However, the CoB is currently only prepared for the 1x1 slot. There is no PCB for the others yet, so it may be better to stay with the 1x1?","",""

Also, I'm not sure if yield is really an issue for this process.","","👍 (1)"
