If you created the logo in magic, then I recommend loading the logo, setting the bounding box with
```
select top cell
property FIXED_BBOX [box values]
lef write <lef_file> -hide
```

Before that, you could load the lef in klayout to see if the coordinates match the gds. If they don't, then you might try the above solution.","",""
