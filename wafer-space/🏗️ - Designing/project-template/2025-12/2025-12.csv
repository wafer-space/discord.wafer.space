Does anyone know where OUTPUT_CAP_LOAD and MAX_CAPACITANCE_CONSTRAINT is defined? Also, I quickly looked through the IO lib files and noticed a max capacitance of 30 while MAX_CAPACITANCE_CONSTRAINT is set to  0.2. I'm assuming this is good for internal cells but is 0.2 correct for the pads and can it be relaxed? Has anyone gotten around the cap and slew violations?","",""
