I'm getting a couple of hundred klayout DRCs in the standard cell region. They're all `CO.6a (i) Metal1 (< 0.34um) end-of-line overlap contact`. Only other mention I found on this discord was https://discord.com/channels/1361349522684510449/1424739011846471740/1424745841952030860. Any ideas what could be causing that? I'm using 9-track cells if that helps

I have to confess I've not merged the project template for about a week and a half, so I could be missing some updates


[11/27/2025 14:29] _luke_w_
here is one point it flagged between 33/0 and 34/0 (presumably m1 and contact). 1 box = 20 nm

I'm trying to understand the rule but ... it's not super clear TBH 😅


[11/27/2025 14:32] 246tnt
Can you zoom out a bit ? Does the line "end" there ?


[11/27/2025 14:32] tholin
I know this rule!


[11/27/2025 14:32] tholin
It needs some metal right here

There is a separate contact overlap minimum for traces that are exactly the minimum-width and at the end of their line.


[11/27/2025 14:33] 246tnt
Well KLayout seems convinced it does, but I'm not sure it's not an error in the KLayout deck.
For me I see that as falling in the CO.6b case.


[11/27/2025 14:35] tholin
When a trace terminates at a contact, then the edge opposite to where the trace extends is the "end of line"

[11/27/2025 14:36] tholin
In these cases, additional overlap is needed


[11/27/2025 14:36] tholin
Which is only partially true for the example shown here, but it seems its still covered by the rule.


[11/27/2025 14:37] tholin
For now, I suggest adding the affected standard cells to the exclude lists.


[11/27/2025 14:38] 246tnt
OTOH that cell library was made by GF so when there is doubt, I tend to suspect the KLayout deck more.


[11/27/2025 14:38] tholin
Actually, the overlap shown here is *tiny.* I doubt this would pass even magic DRC.


[11/27/2025 14:39] 246tnt
CO.6b rule is specially for that case that says if the overlap is less than 40 nm you can "compensate" by having a bigger overlap on the adjacent sides.


[11/27/2025 14:39] 246tnt
But I agree that excluding the affected cell is the easiest thing to do given the time constraints.


[11/27/2025 14:52] _luke_w_
This is a zoom-out of the same region. It doesn't end, just necks down

[11/27/2025 14:53] _luke_w_
actually this looks like it is inside of one of the std cells 🤔


[11/27/2025 14:54] _luke_w_
yeah, it's an icgtp_1
