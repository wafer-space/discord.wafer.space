I've been using the vendor verilog as well. I assumed it was correct (looking to be a mistake?) and didn't trust myself to write a correct behavior stub. 😅  I've been getting data in/out but if there was a timing discrepancy I probably chalked it up to my own timing issues and just worked around it in my code
