Yes, the default is to find roots automatically. In OpenLane 2 there didn’t seem to be a way to explicitly specify roots, I don’t know if things have improved since then.

If the gated clock only feeds a small number of cells, I believe you can avoid getting a full clock tree built for it by explicitly instantiating a buffer after the gate, which should reduce the skew.
