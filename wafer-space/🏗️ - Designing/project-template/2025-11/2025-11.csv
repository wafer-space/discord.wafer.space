Up at the top (not sure if this is important just caught my eye):
`Using NULL graphics device.`

Then at the bottom:
`Cannot open .../librelane/runs/RUN_2025-11-28_00-08-28/73-magic-streamout/chip_top.magic.gds to write GDS-II stream output`

I only have a `chip_top.mag` , no .magic.gds.","",""

You can try to increase it with `ulimit`. A proper fix would be for LibreLane to tell magic it doesn't have to lock the files. It's on my list...","",""
