```
Total number of Clock Roots: 6.
```

I have four defined clocks with two gates on one of those clocks. If I rebuild with the ICG cells removed, I get

```
Total number of Clock Roots: 4.
```
Is Triton treating each gate as a new root? Normally ICGs are just buffers for CTS purposes, and you'd explicitly define a root if you wanted a root","",""

What happens if we submit a design that validates fine but doesn't meet GF's internal checks?","",""

There are also a bunch of rules that are not MR. i.e. they would affect the performance or function, but are not manufacturing risk, so they don't care so much, it's sort of your problem.","",""
