gf180mcu_fd_ip_sram__sram512x8m8wm1.v:132:28: Unsupported: minimum/typical/maximum delay expressions. Using the typical delay
  132 |   specparam Tcyc = 55600 : 55600 : 55600;
      |       
```

This is a typical error. I got this weeks ago and replaced the entire sram section with those with a:

```verilog
`ifndef VERILATOR
  specparam Tcyc = 55600 : 55600 : 55600;
...
`endif
``` 

Then outside the specify block I did:

```verilog
`ifdef VERILATOR
  parameter Tcyc = 8183;
  parameter Tckh = 4000;
  parameter Tckl = 4000;
...
`endif
```

Is there a better way? Since now it's failing all github deployments automatically since it's using the repo direct and not my local changes.","",""
