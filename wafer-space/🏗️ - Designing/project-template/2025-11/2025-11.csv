That is definitely cool to have, but imho it is very rare that someone is using paddle controllers with C64, maybe it is used for something else as well, but I think not related to SID/C64s audio capabilities.","",""

If that's the case, then increasing the hold slack margin should mostly resolve the hold violations.
If there are still some remaining, taking a closer look at the timing paths can be helpful.","",""
