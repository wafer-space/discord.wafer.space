28 cores, with each processor making use of the SRAM block for registerfile/program text and ram.
A small FSM pre-loads each cores memory from SPI flash. (similar to an FPGAs bitstream)
The cores are connected via a cross-bar to peripherals. One of which enables core to core communication, via queues or flags.","project-template_media/chip_top_black-B7C64.png","🎉 (1)"
