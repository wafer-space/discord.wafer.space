Antenna check is going on 18h, so I think I'll give up on it 😅

Thanks!

Yeah, I also remember it taking forever during my testing 😅
For the second shuttle, I can look into rewriting/improving the KLayout antenna checks (there have been some updates to KLayout), or using a magic antenna check. But I don't see how we can possibly enforce zero antenna violations on the first shuttle.
