some dumb pad questions 🙃  :

- we can reconfigure input vs bidirectional pads to suit our design, right? should we leave VDD/VSS alone?
- what's the actual difference between input and bidir? bidir just has extra stuff for sourcing output current or something? (i.e. why would you prefer input over bidir set to input)
- what should I do with unused pins? Set to bidir and bidir_ie = 0 "ignore pad" ?

* yes, all pads are the same size (the two bidi types, the input-only, and the power pads) so changing pad types does not change the pad coordinates
* VDD/VSS need to be left alone to stay bond-compatible with the COBs; you can move them around if you don't rely on the default COB setup
* One case you'd prefer input is for a global reset input, because you don't want that to spuriously enable its output driver during power-up. Pretty much everything else can be bidi
* Tying off A = IE = OE = 0 is one option, you could also put a small hardcoded UART that prints a rude message

awesome, thanks!

And lol at the rude message 😄

Or any message. Spare chips could then be used to advertise "BreakingTaps!\r\n" at 9600bps. 😎
