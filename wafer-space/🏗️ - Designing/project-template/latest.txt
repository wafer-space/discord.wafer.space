No errors in magic

Yes, looking at that now. I think there is a missing marker layer.


[11/22/2025 17:47] 246tnt
5V and 6V transistors have no difference except the channel length.


[11/22/2025 17:48] tholin
What is the marker layer?


[11/22/2025 17:48] 246tnt
And there is a marker layer (purely informational, doesn't mean anything for manufacturing) to tell klayout that a given transistor is meant to be 5V and not 6V.

v5_xtor


[11/22/2025 17:50] 246tnt
112/1

`string MASKHINTS_V5_XTOR` does not have an effect. Will actually have to draw this in KLayout.


[11/22/2025 17:51] 246tnt
Yeah, MASKHINTS only works if support for maskhints for that particular layer is in the tech file.


[11/22/2025 17:51] 246tnt
@Tim Edwards it seems `magic` isn't creating that layer at all, I see no support for writing it in the tech file ?


[11/22/2025 17:51] tholin
But also, these are supposed to be 6V devices


[11/22/2025 17:52] tholin
But also, magic extracts them as 5V?


[11/22/2025 17:52] tholin
There is weird things going on here


[11/22/2025 17:59] tholin
Oh no, the transistors are indeed too small for 6V devices - and magic doesn’t see a problem with that.


[11/22/2025 17:59] tholin
In other words, I’d like to report a bug...


[11/22/2025 18:08] 246tnt
I'm guessing the `mv` devices (which are the ones used in your design) are meant to be the 5V one and the `hv` would be the 6V ones.


[11/22/2025 18:10] 246tnt
Ah no, I think magic doesn't differentiate between 5V and 6V devices at all.


[11/22/2025 18:10] 246tnt
both are `mvnfet` / `mvpfet` and it's just whatever length you use that will dictate which one it is ...


[11/22/2025 18:17] tholin
hv is 10V


[11/22/2025 18:18] tholin
GF180mcu has LV, MV 5V, MV 6V, Native Vt, HV LDMOS


[11/22/2025 18:18] tholin
Which are 3.3V, 5V, 6V, 6V and 10V respectively.


[11/22/2025 18:20] tholin
Here is another DRC error that I’m seeing a lot of in KLayout but that isn’t represented in magic.

Even though it totally could be.


[11/22/2025 18:25] 246tnt
I think there are also drc not checked by klayout because anything wider than 30u must be slitted and it didn't spot that.


[11/22/2025 18:42] 246tnt
@mole99 I think the KLayout deck has issues.


[11/22/2025 18:42] 246tnt
"M3.2b : Space to wide Metal3 (length & width > 10um) : 0.3µm"

That's a 0.28u trace ... hardly "wide Metal3".
