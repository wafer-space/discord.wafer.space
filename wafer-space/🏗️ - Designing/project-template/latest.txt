oh! I didn't know you could put multiple instances in one macro block in the tcl stuff: https://github.com/mithro/gf180mcu-ic-1x1-sram-u8b24k/blob/main/librelane/pdn_cfg.tcl#L177

i dumbly repeated the _grid,_connect, and _stripe stuff for each macro block 🤦‍♂️

Be careful, the AI might have hallucinated it can do that 😛

Although if an AI hallucinates an API, that has been a good indicator that maybe that API ***should*** actually exist.

@Tim 'mithro' Ansell : "Users are reporting being unable to edit their project title. . . They do appear for staff users"---Quick solution:  Make everybody part of the staff!  Then you can also promote how quickly your company has grown!

As the only investor in this company is me, I doubt they will be convinced 😉

The instance name does not have to be complete. I used `u_sram` in my pdn.tcl

https://github.com/gregdavill/gf180mcu-racquet/blob/develop/librelane/pdn_cfg.tcl#L200 
Which matches all the `u_chip_core.gen_proc_wrapper[<instance_number>].u_proc_wrapper.u_sram` blocks

I was having a hard time working out the voodoo incantation to match both placement in the .yaml, and pdn config. tcl doesn't seem to like `[` `]`, but escaping them stopped them matching anything 🙃
