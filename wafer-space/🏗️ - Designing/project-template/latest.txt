Yes, he created an issue: https://github.com/KLayout/klayout/issues/2231

this'll do, thanks! I assume the cells used in a macro are counted in the instance stdcell count? was trying to get a sense for how many transistors/cells were in my logic but not the sram macros. Not really important, just curious 🙂

I think the SRAM macros are just counted as whole macros, so they don't appear in the cell instance counts there. They're usually custom layout, not standard cells

for a rough transistor count estimate just multiply the number of SRAM bits by 6

oh awesome, that's perfect. cheers
