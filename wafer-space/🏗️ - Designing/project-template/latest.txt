Yes, this is because both the antenna script and the DRC deck consider the dummy shapes for their checks. Since we have dedicated DRC rules for dummy, which ensures they are spaced from active metal, there's no need to include them here. It's on my list :)
In fact, I have already removed the dummy shapes from the connectivity setup.
