They are all `Poly overlap of contact < 0.065um (CO.3)` in 9-track std cells

Looking at the rules in the ciel managed `gf180mcuD` pdk, 
```
co3_l.output('CO.3', 'CO.3 : Poly2 overlap of contact. : 0.07µm')
```
Does wafer.space have it's own version of the pdk?


[12/02/2025 05:45] _luke_w_
I think Leo might have some patches that aren't yet merged (then again that might just be LibreLane)


[12/02/2025 05:46] _luke_w_
ah yeah
```
clone-pdk: ## Clone the GF180MCU PDK repository
    rm -rf $(MAKEFILE_DIR)/gf180mcu
    git clone https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu.git $(MAKEFILE_DIR)/gf180mcu --depth 1
.PHONY: clone-pdk
```

He mentioned there is something odd about how Magic handles contact on this issue: https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template/issues/34

KLayout doesn't flag those cells (for that rule)

9-track foundry standard cells are not clean with KLayout or Magic ...
KLayout violations The clock gating cell icgtp_1 is flagged with the following by klayout: CO.6a : (i) Metal1 (&lt; 0.34um) end-of-line overlap contact (Applies to all &lt; 0.34µm wide metal lines,...

ok so I think my DRC issues are just the logo, looking at the final GDS it's misplaced (apparently the origin being set to lower right corner wasn't honored). A few questions:

- I know KLayout can show DRC violations, but where/what file is that stored in? I'm just seeing json files in the klayout DRC directories
- if I edit the GDS and move it over by hand, think I could restart the flow towards the end? Or will I need to go through the whole build again, fixing it in the config?

weirdly it passed all the non-DRC steps which is why I didn't catch it. even renders out to images fine 🙁


[12/02/2025 05:59] _luke_w_
iirc the file you want ends with `.lyrdb`


[12/02/2025 06:00] _luke_w_
you can open that in klayout after opening your GDS and it will flag coordinates of the violations and which rules they violate
