Hi Trevor, if you want to use the CoB bonding option:

1. Do not change the number of pads on any side. This ensures that the bondpad placement stays exactly the same.
2. The VSS pads are shorted on the default breakout PCB. This is why you should not change any of the ground pins.
3. As for whether you can provide your own PCB, @Andrew Wingate should be able to answer that.

I'm glad you appreciate the updated template. Having all pad instances individually was really too much 😄
