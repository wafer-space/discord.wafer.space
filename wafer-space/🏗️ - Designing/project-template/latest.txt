What flow are you using for LVS? Did you create your own padframe schematic using the io spice files from GF or is there a way to get it from the project template?

The LVS that runs when you do `make librelane`

I see.

@Tholin Be aware that the librelane LVS abstracts any macros and standard cells.
I can advise on a setup to run full device level LVS along with soft connection and ERC checks.

I’m mostly just interested in checking for VDD/VSS shorts

I accidentally created such shorts before and the flow did not fail.
