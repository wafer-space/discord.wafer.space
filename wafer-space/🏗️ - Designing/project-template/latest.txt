Will do, thanks! I was looking through logs and noticed that I forgot to add it to the ignore_disconnected, flatten, etc parts of the config for logo/ID.  hoping that resolves things 🤞

I’d like to learn how to produce nice like @Tholin  GDS renderings, and how to use the TinyTapeout GDS viewer with GF180MCU designs. I noticed that you’ve already integrated support for GF180, and it appears to be working. @urish @Matt Venn
