I noticed the project template SDC file has `set_input_delay -min 0 -clock $clocks $clk_core_input_ports` which sets the hold time on the inputs to zero.  I think that's may be why you've had to turn up the hold slack margin, because it means a bunch of buffering is required on the inputs which is a bit difficult for the flow to get right.
