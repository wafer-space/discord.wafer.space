The I/O pins are on the 3.3V set and I may be seeing violations which others don't see because the 3.3V transistors at the input are smaller and so the ratio is easier to exceed (plus the ratio was only slightly above 400).  The problem is that these pins _are_ connected to antenna diodes.  They have a (to me) weird configuration in which the signal is connected to the nwell of an nwell-to-pdiff diode.  But it is still a valid diode.  But klayout reports zero diode area for the net.","",""

This sounds like the issue everyone was having before the latest implementation.  But I'm supposed to be using the latest fill.  How do I know if the fill pattern generator is current?","",""

The project template sets this in the LibreLane config, however, if you run fill manually then you need to pass the following: `-rd Metal2_ignore_active`","",""
