I wanted to look at adding a yosys extraction for mux + flop -> scan flop but librelane is quite hardcoded.","",""

That's basically the same step as in: https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/nix_installation/installation_linux.html#cloning-librelane
You can also apply patches in the in the Nix flake of the template, but it's a bit finicky.","",""
