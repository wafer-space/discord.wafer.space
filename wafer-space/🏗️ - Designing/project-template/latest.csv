A number of the VDD/VSS pads will be used for the analog power domain in the future.

In addition, the core are of the 0p5x0p5 chip is less than a quarter of that of the 1x1 chip. That's why I reduced the number of power/ground pads considerably.
It may turn out that this is not enough to support the number of I/Os at high speeds, so we might change that again for run 2.","",""
