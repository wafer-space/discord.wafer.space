This shows the example template where the design is quite sparse so there's a lot of routing between the clock buffers and after SPEF extraction the tree isn't as balanced as it should be (that's why I had to increase the hold margin).","project-template_media/Bildschirmfoto_vom_2025-11-30_14-50-47-CC69A.png","👍 (1)"

So I am actually thinking to focus on ZX Spectrum like machine repairs and put ULA (graphics) and AY (audio) instead.","","😮 (1)"

Didn't see the timing report tab either. looking through the violators now, looks like my ALU is popping up in the list which is interesting. didn't think I had anything particularly expensive in there but will give examine it closer.

thanks for all th ehelp!","",""
