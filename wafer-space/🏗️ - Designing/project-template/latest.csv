I found my soft open file limit was 1024 and increasing it with `ulimit -Sn 4096` solved that particular issue.

On MacOS I have a different issue which is that I get actual XORs between KLayout and Magic GDS. I didn't diagnose that, I just stopped using MacOS for now (it also tends to crash in the detailed router).","",""
