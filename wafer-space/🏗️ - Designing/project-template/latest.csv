Interestingly, they are implemented using just digital logic cells because they’re not true ADCs and are more like....resistance to digital converters. Each ADC pin requires a capacitor and resistor (usually a potentiometer) connected to it. The chip runs a loop of pulling those pins low for a bit, before tri-state-inputing them and running a timer until they register a logic one.","",""
