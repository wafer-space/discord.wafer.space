I'd say it depends on your chips use case. If you expect the chip to never deviate from normal operation (no power supply issues) or in hot/cold temps then yes you can ignore them if you choose. However those corners cover cases when you say get a power supply surge/drop or the chip get's really hot/cold so they are very important if you don't assume ideal.","","👍 (1)"

i just found some docs on OpenLane which look helpful for improving my background knowledge too, and some config values to tweak: https://openlane2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/timing_closure/index.html","",""

Setup violations are a different matter — you can always deal with those later by adjusting the clock frequency.","",""
