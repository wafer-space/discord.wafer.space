If you have problems meeting the density limit for one of the layers, you can pass `-rd Metaln_active` to the script, where n is the number of the metal layer. This moves the fill shapes to the active metal layer and thus ignores some of the dummy fill rules.","",""

13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700K

My main computer (powerhouse) is an M1 max mac which the above CPU keeps up with nicely. With all the issues from librelane on mac, I loaded ubuntu onto the Intel chip and have been running pnr for my design on that. No issues since. I still use the mac for cocotb tb and everything else.","",""
