That includes things like:
 * C is full of foot guns, people think it's a low level language and they know the direct mapping to hardware but don't realise all bets are off when a compiler is involved, etc.
 * C++ is a massive language which includes multiple other languages internally, every restricts their usage to some small subsection of the language -- but no one can agree what the right subsection is, etc.","",""
