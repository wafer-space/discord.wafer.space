"384390069412429834","polyfractal","2025-11-26T20:00:14.5790000+00:00","yep. I'm using it for both instruction memory and generic SRAM. so most (all?) of the tests are probably incrementing the address each cycle to fetch a new instruction. the few tests that check branching also jump around but don't hold the same address over multiple clocks. and the general sram tests are just random accesses as well","",""

"803213471402688522","_luke_w_","2025-11-26T20:01:38.5880000+00:00","and you're using the RAM model in both gate sim and behavioural RTL sim?","",""
"384390069412429834","polyfractal","2025-11-26T20:02:56.7390000+00:00","emmm, maybe? I'm using Spade HDL (transpiles to verilog), so copied/pasted the macro verilog into the spade setup so it can reference for tests. 

Not sure if that's gate sim or behavioural? probably behavioural (cocotb tests)","",""
"803213471402688522","_luke_w_","2025-11-26T20:03:35.5380000+00:00","yeah, behavioural. Ok thanks, that's useful information, I need to look at my sims a bit more 🙂 definitely some weird stuff going on in that model","","👍 (1)"

"803213471402688522","_luke_w_","2025-11-26T20:04:18.0270000+00:00","gate sim would be a simulation of the synthesised (or post-place etc) netlist instead of your (transpiled) source code","",""

"803213471402688522","_luke_w_","2025-11-26T20:05:45.9020000+00:00","There is already some setup for it in the template's cocotb harness, if you look through where this variable is used in `chip_top_tb.py`:
```
gl = os.getenv(""GL"", False)

"384390069412429834","polyfractal","2025-11-26T20:07:22.4090000+00:00","ooh interesting. so theoretically the same cocotb tests would run and should match the behavioural testing pre-synth? will try it out when i get home","",""
"803213471402688522","_luke_w_","2025-11-26T20:08:09.2180000+00:00","that is the theory. you can have new issues in gate sim like Xs propagating in places they didn't before, but the netlist should be equivalent to your RTL","",""
