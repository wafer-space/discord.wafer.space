The update to the precheck only affected the antenna check. These issues are probably due to some bad RNG luck.

Are these violations from magic DRC or from KLayout DRC?
Did you verify that these violations are false positives?

If you want help with that issue on Discord, please create a post under #questions.","","😮 (1)"
