It contains a list of all corners and whether there are any setup violations for the target frequency. If there is a setup violation at a corner, it means that you will not be able to run the chip at the target frequency at that particular corner (PVT - Process, Voltage and Temperature). Using the setup worst slack, you can calculate the maximum frequency for each corner, which could even be above the target frequency.","",""
