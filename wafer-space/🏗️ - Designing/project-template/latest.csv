It has been successfully completed.
It took 4 hours and 36 minutes on Ubuntu24.04. The PC specifications are: ""Ryzen 3 Pro 4350G (4-core, 8-thread) & MEM: 64GB"".

However, when running on WSL, Klayout crashed when signals such as SIGKILL were sent  or no response. 
When I used about 14GB of memory, Klayout has crashed.
