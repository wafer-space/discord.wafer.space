- we can reconfigure input vs bidirectional pads to suit our design, right? should we leave VDD/VSS alone?
- what's the actual difference between input and bidir? bidir just has extra stuff for sourcing output current or something? (i.e. why would you prefer input over bidir set to input)
- what should I do with unused pins? Set to bidir and bidir_ie = 0 ""ignore pad"" ?","",""

* VDD/VSS need to be left alone to stay bond-compatible with the COBs; you can move them around if you don't rely on the default COB setup
* One case you'd prefer input is for a global reset input, because you don't want that to spuriously enable its output driver during power-up. Pretty much everything else can be bidi
* Tying off A = IE = OE = 0 is one option, you could also put a small hardcoded UART that prints a rude message","",""
