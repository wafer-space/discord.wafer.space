- I know KLayout can show DRC violations, but where/what file is that stored in? I'm just seeing json files in the klayout DRC directories
- if I edit the GDS and move it over by hand, think I could restart the flow towards the end? Or will I need to go through the whole build again, fixing it in the config?","project-template_media/image-7D824.png",""
