* It drops the first access because it fails to correctly initialise `cen_dly` and `cen_flag_dly`; can be fixed by just using `always_comb` to get a time=0 evaluation
* It registers its inputs on a 100 ps delayed version of the clock, making it unsuitable for RTL simulations which just have an NBA delay on the input for the next cycle","",""

I have a behavioural model in my RAM wrapper which I was using until now, but I wanted to run RTL sims with all my manually-instantiated cells enabled so that pulled in the vendor model.","","👌 (1)"

I was testing the FPGA fabric in my chip and to prevent logic loops during configuration I added delays to it.
In the testbench I was waiting two clock cycles before I read the output. I don't remember if the two clock cycles were really necessary, but I was simply happy to get the correct data out again. 😆 
I didn't have time to take a closer look since then.","",""
