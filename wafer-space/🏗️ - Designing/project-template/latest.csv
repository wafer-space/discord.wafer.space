It would be instructive and maybe helpful in the long term to get photos of one of the original GF open MPW runs, etching the surface away to get a view of each metal layer's fill pattern.  Then we will either come to an understanding of what GF actually does to get correct fill density without violating their own rules, or we'll have evidence to go back to them and insist that they change their rules.","",""

So if we submitted something with the original fill pattern generation, do we need to do anything other than re-run precheck?  Is there even a way on the server to simply re-run the precheck without doing a new upload?","",""

However, it might be better to only enable the exception for those layers that really need it :)","",""

> 1. Check the metal density in an area of 200um by 200um at a step of 100um.
> 2. Add dummy metal if total die metal density is less than 30%

We don't do that, we fill globally and as much as we can.","",""
