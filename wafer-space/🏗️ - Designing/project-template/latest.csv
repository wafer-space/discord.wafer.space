Yes, adding `STD_CELL_LIBRARY` to `slot_*.yaml` instead is a workaround.

I'm suspect that only `STD_CELL_LIBRARY` is affected because it is a special variable that can be set by passing `--scl` to LibreLane. If you see other variables being overwritten, please let me know. However, I think that's unlikely.","",""
