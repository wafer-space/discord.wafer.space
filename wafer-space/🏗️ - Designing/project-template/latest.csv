This update introduces a reworked filler generation that complies with several rules that the foundry did not allow us to waive. This may result in your design not meeting the necessary metal density requirements. Therefore, an option has been added to the filler generation script which enables the dummy fill shapes to be moved to the active metal layer, in order to allow some of these very restrictive rules to be ignored.
This option is enabled by default for the Metal2 layer in the project template, as this layer is most likely to be under the minimum density limit for digital designs.

Additionally, the antenna script has been updated to correctly verify the antenna rules according to the PDK docs. Previously, the check did not take the diode area into account correctly. Thanks to @tnt for identifying the issue and to @Egor Lukyanchenko for providing an updated KLayout implementation.

Furthermore, another issue was discovered in the antenna script.
Similar to the DRC deck, the comp layer needs to be cut by the poly gate to prevent shorts in the extracted netlist. This was less obvious than in the DRC deck, since the antenna check starts with the lower layers and progresses to the upper layers. It is expected for the check to get progressively slower - but not to this extent!
The antenna check should now finish in reasonable time, even for very complex designs.
(Previously, one design with a lot of combinatorial logic timed out on the online platform. Now the antenna check for this design completes in 13.7 minutes on my machine.)","","❤️ (2)"

  - Correctly implement antenna checks based on `ANTENNADIFFSIDEAREARATIO`.
  - Fix shorts in the antenna connectivity setup.
  - Update the magic tech file from open_pdks.
  - Filler generation:
    - Comply with DPF.12, DPF.13, DM.4_DM.6, DM.5_DM.7 and DPF.1.
    - Add option to the filler generation to move a dummy metal layer to active metal and ignore DM.4_DM.6 and DM.5_DM.7.

- Project template [1.3.0](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template/releases/tag/1.3.0)
  - Update the LibreLane branch.
  - Enable active dummy fill for Metal2 layer.

- Precheck [1.5.0](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck/releases/tag/1.5.0)
  - Update the LibreLane branch.

Please make sure to update the wafer.space logo in the template repo, as its shapes have been copied to all metal layers to make it easier to meet the global density requirements.

Note: If your design passes the latest precheck, it is eligible for tapeout.","",""
