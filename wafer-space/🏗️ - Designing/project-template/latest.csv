This tapeout has 13 different projects on it, coming from our students or from our research departments.
Some of our highlights are the game Tetris and a RISC-V CPU for our TinyWhisper project. And of course, our students are excited to tape their first chip. 🙌 

The starting template has also been extended with some more Makefile targets to also build specific macros, copy important reports `copy-reports`, and copy & ZIP the GDS for submission `copy-gds`. There is also a Makefile target `build-all`, which enables everyone to simply clone the repo, install the `nix-shell`, execute `make build-all` in it, and the whole chip will be built submission-ready. Maybe this is useful for someone for future runs. Feel free to use it. 🙂

A big shoutout to @Leo Moser (mole99), who supported us during this journey. Another thanks to @Tholin and his project (https://github.com/AvalonSemiconductors/ws-submission-2025/), which served as a reference for using macros. Thanks @Tim 'mithro' Ansell and everyone else involved, for making this possible. 🙂
