It currently runs on an FPGA at 30 MHz, using the same setup we have on wafer.space GF180mcu.
We’ll show a short demo over the serial console; the rest will be  over Telnet, we support spi/ethernet on the chip.
The design will become a tiny Linux network SoC. It already runs XV6 (the MIT teaching Unix) , and μLinux.","project-template_media/Screencast_from_2025-11-28_22-01-42-D65CD.webm",""
