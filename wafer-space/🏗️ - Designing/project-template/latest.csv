"323371864074485771","mole99","2025-10-02T16:40:54.7030000+00:00","📢 Major update to the [gf180mcu-project-template](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-project-template)! 

The example design now runs through the complete flow, including:

- Sealring insertion
- Filler generation

... and is DRC and LVS clean, according to the open source PDK.

There is now also a [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org/) testbench available in the repository. We use the newly released cocotb 2.0.0.
You can run RTL as well as GL simulations, after implementing the design.

To ensure your design will be accepted for tapeout, you will be able to run the [gf180mcu-precheck](https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck).
At the moment it is still a work in progress.

Further updates will follow, but you can use the current state as a stable basis for implementing your design.
If you encounter any issues, please report them so that we can improve both the template and the PDK.

PS: Special thanks to @Tim Edwards for his help in solving the uncovered PDK and tool-related issues.

Yesterday, I implemented the example template on my laptop, which also has 16 GB of RAM, and it had to use swap as well.

The step that uses the most memory atm is most likely the filler generation.
There you can easily trade off memory consumption by changing the number of tiles (threads) and their size.
I will add some LibreLane configuration variables so that this can be easily tweaked directly from the config.
In the meantime, you can pass the `--jobs` argument to LibreLane to limit the global thread limit across all steps.","","👍 (1)"

The project template has been updated with support for the foundry SRAMs!
Two SRAMs of type `sram512x8m8wm1` are instantiated in `chip_core` and placed inside the chip in two different orientations (north and east).
If you add more SRAMs, make sure to update the LibreLane config (`librelane/config.yaml`) and the PDN configuration (`librelane/pdn_cfg.tcl`).

In addition, an issue has been fixed with filler generation, the way how the KLayout DRC deck was invoked (connectivity rules), and an error in the seal ring generator. With these changes the template is now DRC clean for both the magic and KLayout DRC deck.
Furthermore, the design is LVS clean and the there are no setup and hold violations for this example.

Please update your projects to the latest template, and don't forget to update the PDK as well (`make clone-pdk`).
Let me know if you have any questions.","","waferspace (5),👍 (2),🎉 (1)"

Just so you know, the CI only runs the implementation, as the DRC requires too much memory. So you need to make sure to run DRC locally.

Yes, there are ways to upload artifacts: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/store-and-share-data
I haven't added this to the CI yet since I though it would quicky fill up the available storage space. But perhaps with a compression of the artifacts and a short retention time, it could be fine?","","❤️ (1)"
