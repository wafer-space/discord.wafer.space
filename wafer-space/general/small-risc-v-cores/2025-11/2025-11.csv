You're going to want a QSPI interface to some RAM and flash, so that's 7 or preferably 12 IOs.  And then 4 or 8 IOs for actually doing something.  By the time you've made that pad ring you might as well put at least enough RAM in it for registers.

But yes, I believe SERV can be configured to store registers in external RAM, that will be extremely slow though!

I think going for RV32E (only 15 registers) makes sense.  Also if you support the compressed instructions (which is good to save flash bandwidth if you have no/minimal icache) they mostly can only use registers that are in RV32E anyway.","",""

I know in both ihp and sky, placing anything active under the pad is a not an option.  And on sky in early mpw some people had high failure rate when bonding because there was some stuff under the pad that was getting crushed.","",""
