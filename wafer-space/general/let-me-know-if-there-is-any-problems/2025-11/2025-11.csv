Just to confirm, I first need to implement the `example_project` by going into `example_project` and running `make project`, right?

Ciel will then fetch the PDK that is marked supported by LibreLane. However I get stuck at GlobalPlacement:

```
Iter   |    Area   | Removed | Inserted |   Pins
|           | Buffers | Buffers  | Remaining
-------------------------------------------------------
0 |     +0.0% |       0 |        0 |       468
46 |     +0.0% |       0 |        0 |       422
92 |     +0.0% |       0 |        0 |       376
[CRITICAL RSZ-2008] buffering pin _545_/ZN: wire step options empty
```

Could it be that you implemented the `example_project` with a different version of LibreLane than in the nix-shell of this repository?
If so - that would be great! Then I would have another reproducible for [#8229](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/issues/8229), which is not related to the I/O pads.","",""
