Thanks for asking, but I don't think this is necessary for wafer.space.

Since the users can swap out the pad types in the pad ring, they can simply use an input-only pad when they need one.
Also, as we don't have the complexity of Caravel, the final behaviour can be directly observed in the top-level GL simulation, which includes the pad cells.","",""
