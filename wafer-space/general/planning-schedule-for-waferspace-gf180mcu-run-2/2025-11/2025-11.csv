It is currently expected that Run #1 will come back in March 2026. I'm thinking it's best to have the closing time for Run #2 sometime after that so people can demonstrate working silicon.

I would love thoughts, suggestions, opinions on what type of timeline makes sense to people.","","💜 (1),waferspace (1),👍 (2)"

Unless there is is enough demand to completely fill a run #2 before that ( which I doubt ), I don't really see any benefit into making it before.","",""

- Mid March: TTIHP26a
- Early April: TTSKY26a
- Early June: TTSKY26b

So either Feb or early May would probably be good","",""

Four runs might be quite a lot initially. Maybe you want to reduce them for 2026?","",""

Beside the obvious ""does it work"" and ""demo effect"" :
(1) being the first run, there is also the question of how packaging / bonding will work out which might influence what people want to do for the next runs.
(2) I don't have the numbers, but I would expect the first few runs might end up being run at a loss and it might take time for people to get moving designing stuff, so not burning all capital before that happens would be good 😅","",""
