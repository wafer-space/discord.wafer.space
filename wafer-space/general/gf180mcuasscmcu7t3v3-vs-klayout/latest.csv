The only issue we had to fix were NP.2/PP.2 violations. The Nplus/Pplus layers are not drawn but autogenerated by magic and they don't take abutment into account. You can fix most cells by extending Nplus/Pplus to the cell boundary (or slightly over). The sole exception is the tap cell where I had to redraw a few layers.","",""
