Excited for this! 👏 I assume you meant 512B, though 😉
Does this entail shrinking only the SRAM bitcell or the periphery too?

Um, yes, 512B.
I have so far shrunk the core array but everything will be scaled down appropriately and matched to the pitch of the core cells.

Well, that's no easy task. I wish you the best of luck 🤞
