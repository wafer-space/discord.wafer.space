I just had a look at the layout in https://github.com/ishi-kai/ISHI-KAI_Multiple_Projects_WaferSapce-GF180-1/blob/main/gds/ISHI-KAI_WS_RUN1.zip and I noticed that the core area does not contain any filler cells. Does your design comply with the density rules?

I also saw that you moved the QR code from the bottom left corner to the top left corner. While this is fine, is there a reason for it?

Thanks!","",""

I have not checked yet.
Is there a filler script?","",""

I have also modified this one. The bottom left is the QR and the top right is the Wafer.Space logo.","",""

There may be a few more updates to the template, in which case you will need to rerun filler generation (sorry!). I'll notify you in the #project-template channel when it's ready.","","🆗 (1)"
