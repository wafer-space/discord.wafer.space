Great work!

I just had a look at the layout in https://github.com/ishi-kai/ISHI-KAI_Multiple_Projects_WaferSapce-GF180-1/blob/main/gds/ISHI-KAI_WS_RUN1.zip and I noticed that the core area does not contain any filler cells. Does your design comply with the density rules?

I also saw that you moved the QR code from the bottom left corner to the top left corner. While this is fine, is there a reason for it?

Thanks!

FYI your design needs to pass this precheck: https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu-precheck

I have not checked yet.
Is there a filler script?

Yes, it is here: https://github.com/wafer-space/gf180mcu/tree/main/gf180mcuD/libs.tech/klayout/tech/drc/filler_generation

I modified the density rules and committed the changes.

I have also modified this one. The bottom left is the QR and the top right is the Wafer.Space logo.

Great! Thanks for the change, that ensures that we can manufacture the chip.
There may be a few more updates to the template, in which case you will need to rerun filler generation (sorry!). I'll notify you in the #project-template channel when it's ready.
