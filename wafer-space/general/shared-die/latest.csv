* maybe 1mm2 area
* Up to 30 digital IOs (or some mix of I, O, and IO)
* probably 4 analog pins
* I need bonding… COB or packaged parts
* caravel is optional for me","",""

Nice, thanks for the list. 
Let's see if we can get a few more people on board to help bring the cost down.","",""

- ~1mm2 area
- 6 pins : 4 digital ( 1 IO, 2 I, 1 O), 1 power, 1 gnd","",""
