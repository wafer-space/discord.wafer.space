From Sim to Silicon: Reuse Your Testbenches with Hardware-in-the-Loop
Real chip verification, out in the wild, for FPGA, ASIC and more:  turn your simulation tests into live hardware probes. Deep VCDs from digital designs, in-circuit.  These are some of the cool things you can do with microcotb and I'll show them all in this guide to digital IC testing.

Update: a mailing list is where it'...
