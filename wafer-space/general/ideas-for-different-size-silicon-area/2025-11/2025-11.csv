"169786952432746498","mithro_","2025-08-21T20:02:27.2270000+00:00","To be a little clearer;
 * (a) Eventually I hope that I can support any die size and use something like laser dicing. For now that is an added complexity / risk it doesn't make sense to take on (kinda like the gf180mcu process optimization idea that I abandoned).

 * (b) In the shorter term, given that you get back bare die by default, I believe there could be a few options for post processing to split them into even smaller units.","",""

 * $7 USD per die really means a >$100 USD product.
 * $1 USD per die means that <$30 USD or even $10 USD type products become viable.","",""

"169786952432746498","mithro_","2025-08-21T20:07:01.3680000+00:00","@tnt - ""scale"" is a relative term, ~1,000 units it pretty small for PCBA and non-existant scale for semiconductor people.","",""
"169786952432746498","mithro_","2025-08-21T20:13:08.3980000+00:00","Actually, if it's $7 USD per die and you want $1 USD per sub-die, then you can spend ~$1 USD per die to do the dicing.","",""
"596068704471482370","246tnt","2025-08-21T20:16:57.6570000+00:00","By scale I meant, not 10 units done by hand.
Because if you get the die in a gel pack like we dit from the skywater runs, I'm not sure how you put them in a laser dicing machine ""in bulk"" since the ones I've seen take full wafers ...","",""
"596068704471482370","246tnt","2025-08-21T20:18:24.2160000+00:00","But it's not like I have tons of experience with dicing so it's very possible there is a way 🤷","",""
