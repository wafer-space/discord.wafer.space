You probably have a list of things that still need to be done, but I'll also add my observations here.

wafer.space in the top-left corner could use the wafer.space logo.

The background of "Welcome to wafer.space" could be an image like this one: https://wafer.space/assets/images/products/gf180mcu-wafer-isometric.jpg

The localization seems to work only partially. An option to disable it completely would also be nice (in the profile settings?).

The alignment is off. All "Sign up with" text should be aligned. The input fields underneath should also be aligned in some way I think.

I did receive the confirmation email and it is mostly fine. I suppose you cannot easily change the text? Or is the localization data part of your repository?

The about page is missing.

The localization must be a thing that comes with the social auth plugin...

👍

[10/27/2025 13:42] mithro_
I didn't even think about localization

The process to sign up was very clear. I did not run into any issues.
Is the precheck already integrated? I will give it a try later.

We should probably also tell some suggested ways to upload the layout.
It is not recommnded to host it in the repository as this bloats the git history. Better to create a release with the layout attached.

We should also link to the project template.


[10/27/2025 13:43] mithro_
The downloading bit works, running the precheck is the next step.


[10/27/2025 17:14] mole99
All right, let me know when I can give it a try!


[10/28/2025 02:58] mithro_
@mole99 - Would be good to check it downloads your gds/oas file correctly.

The download seems to be successful, but the file name is strange. The file is called `chip_top.gds.gz`.

The checkpoints seem to be non functional?

I have no idea what this manufacturability check is. We don't have 50nm feature size 😆 (Just a placeholder for now?)


[10/30/2025 03:45] mithro_
I have no idea where that is coming from! 😛

Looks like the platform is down ATM?
