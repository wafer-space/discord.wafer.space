The localization seems to work only partially. An option to disable it completely would also be nice (in the profile settings?).","",""

Is the precheck already integrated? I will give it a try later.

We should probably also tell some suggested ways to upload the layout.
It is not recommnded to host it in the repository as this bloats the git history. Better to create a release with the layout attached.

We should also link to the project template.","",""
