```
Data matrix is my personal choice for now. 

At macro scales this can also be used as pin 1 designator

They also can be dots and not full squares.
```

This all applies to QR-codes as well, doesn't it? I would say that the orientation is easier to decode in a QR-code.
If there's no major benefit to a data matrix, I would choose a QR-Code. Simply because for ""normal"" users this is much easier to read (it is supported by a lot of software nowadays). What is the maximum ECC you can get for a data matrix?","",""

It does yes

I also believe data matrix does not need an orientation to read. 

Seems you can lose 30% with [Data_Matrix_ECC_200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix#Data_Matrix_ECC_200)

If you want a URL in the layout just for ""coolness"" (I get it 😉) you can simply add it to some projects. In the core are you're not limited by size and can scale it up so that even a phone camera can read it.
