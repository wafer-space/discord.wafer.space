```
Data matrix is my personal choice for now. 

At macro scales this can also be used as pin 1 designator

They also can be dots and not full squares.
```

This all applies to QR-codes as well, doesn't it? I would say that the orientation is easier to decode in a QR-code.
If there's no major benefit to a data matrix, I would choose a QR-Code. Simply because for ""normal"" users this is much easier to read (it is supported by a lot of software nowadays). What is the maximum ECC you can get for a data matrix?","",""

It does yes

I also believe data matrix does not need an orientation to read. 

Seems you can lose 30% with [Data_Matrix_ECC_200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix#Data_Matrix_ECC_200) 
I think the benefit is size but I  have not done the math","waferspacediesorter_media/image-EDD0C.png,waferspacediesorter_media/image-48484.png",""

Machine readability makes things super easy for me. 
With a cheap microscope you should be able to read one if we get to use the whole area in that corner. (That is the 125um square, correct) example in pasted pic 

This choice may make things a little harder for me, but that can remain my problem, but should be easy enough for someone with cheap tools to resolve--keep in mind that I was unable to resolve any of the numbers with the Efabless versions of the numbers.","waferspacediesorter_media/image-3D59F.png",""

If you want a URL in the layout just for ""coolness"" (I get it 😉) you can simply add it to some projects. In the core are you're not limited by size and can scale it up so that even a phone camera can read it.
